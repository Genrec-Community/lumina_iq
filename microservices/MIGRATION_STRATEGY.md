# Learning App Microservices Migration Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the phased migration strategy from the current monolithic architecture to a microservices-based system, designed to improve performance and scalability while minimizing risks.

## Current Performance Issues
- **Question Generation**: 10-15 minutes (Target: 2-3 minutes)
- **Evaluation Processing**: 10-15 minutes (Target: 1-2 minutes)
- **Monolithic Architecture**: Single point of failure, difficult to scale

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Week 1)
**Objective**: Establish foundational infrastructure without disrupting current system

#### Tasks:
1. **Database Setup**
   - Install PostgreSQL alongside current system
   - Create database schemas using shared models
   - Set up connection pooling and health checks
   - **Risk**: Minimal - runs parallel to existing system

2. **Redis Setup**
   - Install Redis for caching and message queuing
   - Configure connection pooling and persistence
   - Test caching functionality
   - **Risk**: Low - independent of current system

3. **Docker Environment**
   - Create Docker containers for all services
   - Set up docker-compose for local development
   - Configure networking and volumes
   - **Risk**: Low - development environment only

4. **Shared Libraries**
   - Develop shared database models and utilities
   - Create API key management system
   - Build caching utilities
   - **Risk**: Low - reusable components

**Success Criteria**:
- PostgreSQL and Redis running and accessible
- Docker environment functional
- Shared libraries tested and documented

### Phase 2: Service Extraction (Week 2-3)
**Objective**: Extract services one by one, starting with least critical

#### 2.1 Extract Authentication Service
- **Why First**: Independent, well-defined boundaries
- **Migration**: 
  - Create auth microservice with JWT tokens
  - Migrate user sessions to database
  - Test authentication flows
- **Rollback**: Keep existing auth as fallback
- **Risk**: Low - authentication is stateless

#### 2.2 Extract PDF Processing Service
- **Why Second**: Clear boundaries, existing caching
- **Migration**:
  - Move PDF upload/processing logic
  - Migrate file metadata to database
  - Implement enhanced caching with Redis
- **Rollback**: Route requests back to monolith
- **Risk**: Medium - file handling complexity

#### 2.3 Extract Chat Service
- **Why Third**: Real-time features, moderate complexity
- **Migration**:
  - Move chat logic to separate service
  - Migrate chat history to database
  - Implement WebSocket support for real-time updates
- **Rollback**: Fallback to monolithic chat
- **Risk**: Medium - real-time features

**Success Criteria**:
- Each service runs independently
- API Gateway routes requests correctly
- All existing functionality preserved

### Phase 3: Performance-Critical Services (Week 4-5)
**Objective**: Extract and optimize the performance bottlenecks

#### 3.1 Extract Question Generation Service
- **High Priority**: Major performance bottleneck
- **Migration**:
  - Move question generation to dedicated service
  - Implement Celery for background processing
  - Add parallel processing (5 questions per chunk)
  - Implement intelligent caching
- **Optimizations**:
  - Chunked generation: 5 questions per AI call
  - Background jobs with progress tracking
  - WebSocket for real-time updates
  - Cache by document hash + parameters
- **Expected Improvement**: 10-15 minutes → 2-3 minutes
- **Risk**: High - critical functionality

#### 3.2 Extract Evaluation Service
- **High Priority**: Major performance bottleneck
- **Migration**:
  - Move evaluation logic to dedicated service
  - Implement batch evaluation processing
  - Add parallel evaluation workers
  - Implement evaluation caching
- **Optimizations**:
  - Batch processing: 5-10 answers per AI call
  - Parallel workers for concurrent evaluation
  - Answer similarity detection for cache hits
  - Pre-computed scoring for MCQ questions
- **Expected Improvement**: 10-15 minutes → 1-2 minutes
- **Risk**: High - critical functionality

**Success Criteria**:
- Question generation completes in under 3 minutes
- Evaluation completes in under 2 minutes
- Background job monitoring functional
- Cache hit rates above 70%

### Phase 4: API Gateway and Optimization (Week 6)
**Objective**: Implement API Gateway and final optimizations

#### Tasks:
1. **API Gateway Implementation**
   - Route all requests through gateway
   - Implement rate limiting and load balancing
   - Add request/response logging
   - Implement circuit breaker pattern

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Fine-tune caching strategies
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Add performance monitoring

3. **Load Testing**
   - Test with simulated high load
   - Verify performance improvements
   - Test failover scenarios
   - Validate cache effectiveness

**Success Criteria**:
- All requests routed through API Gateway
- Performance targets achieved
- System handles expected load
- Monitoring and alerting functional

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Backward Compatibility
- **Feature Flags**: Toggle between old and new implementations
- **Dual Routing**: Route requests to both systems during transition
- **Data Synchronization**: Keep data in sync between systems

### 2. Rollback Plans
- **Service Level**: Individual services can be rolled back
- **Database**: Database migrations are reversible
- **Configuration**: Environment variables control routing

### 3. Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Each service has comprehensive tests
- **Integration Tests**: Test service communication
- **Performance Tests**: Validate performance improvements
- **Load Tests**: Ensure system handles expected traffic

### 4. Monitoring and Alerting
- **Health Checks**: Each service has health endpoints
- **Performance Metrics**: Track response times and throughput
- **Error Tracking**: Monitor error rates and types
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track CPU, memory, and database usage

## Data Migration Strategy

### 1. Database Migration
- **Parallel Databases**: Run PostgreSQL alongside current storage
- **Data Sync**: Implement sync mechanisms during transition
- **Validation**: Verify data integrity after migration

### 2. Cache Migration
- **Redis Implementation**: Replace file-based cache with Redis
- **Cache Warming**: Pre-populate cache with frequently accessed data
- **Fallback**: Maintain file cache as backup during transition

### 3. File Storage
- **Shared Volumes**: Use Docker volumes for PDF storage
- **Path Migration**: Update file paths in database
- **Backup**: Ensure file backups before migration

## Performance Validation

### 1. Benchmarking
- **Baseline Measurements**: Record current performance
- **Target Metrics**: Define success criteria
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Track improvements throughout migration

### 2. Load Testing
