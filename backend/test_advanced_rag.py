Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as training data, to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled training data, and makes predictions based on that data. For example, classification problems where the output can be of two forms: yes or no, true or false, spam or not spam.

2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm learns from unlabeled data, finding hidden patterns or intrinsic structures. Clustering is a common example where the algorithm groups similar data points together.

3. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties based on the actions it performs. This is commonly used in game playing and robotics.

Applications of Machine Learning include:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for chatbots and translation
- Computer Vision for image recognition and autonomous vehicles  
- Recommendation systems for e-commerce and content platforms
- Fraud detection in financial services
- Medical diagnosis and drug discovery
- Predictive maintenance in manufacturing

Key Concepts in Machine Learning:

Training Data: The dataset used to train the machine learning model. Quality and quantity of training data significantly impact model performance.

Features: Individual measurable properties or characteristics of the data being observed. Feature engineering is the process of selecting and transforming relevant features.

Model: The mathematical representation learned from training data. Common models include Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines.

Overfitting: When a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers, leading to poor performance on new data.

Validation: The process of evaluating the model's performance on unseen data to ensure it generalizes well.

Deep Learning: A subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with multiple layers. It excels at processing unstructured data like images, audio, and text.

The future of machine learning involves:
- AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) for easier model development
- Explainable AI to make models more interpretable
- Federated Learning for privacy-preserving training
- Quantum Machine Learning for exponentially faster computations
- Edge AI for running ML models on devices rather than cloud

To fully test Advanced RAG:

1. Start the backend server:
   cd backend
   python run.py

2. Upload a document:
   - Use the web interface or API
   - Upload a PDF with substantial content (5+ pages)

3. Generate questions with Advanced RAG:
   - Topic-specific: POST /api/chat/generate-questions
     {
       "topic": "Machine Learning",
       "count": 25,
       "mode": "quiz"
     }
   
   - Comprehensive: POST /api/chat/generate-questions
     {
       "count": 50,
       "mode": "practice"
     }

4. Observe the logs:
   - "Using ADVANCED RAG with N chunks"
   - "Content Difficulty: advanced/medium/basic"
   - Chunk metadata with scores

5. Compare question quality:
   - Topic coverage (how many different aspects covered)
   - Difficulty range (from basic recall to analysis)
   - Factual accuracy (answers derivable from document)
   - Diversity (variety in question types)

Expected Results:
✓ 15-25 chunks retrieved (vs 8 with simple RAG)
✓ Higher information density scores
✓ Better Bloom's taxonomy distribution
✓ More diverse topics covered
✓ Higher quality questions overall
