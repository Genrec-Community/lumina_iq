  "text": "How to Develop  \nASUPER-POWER  \nMEMORY  \nby Harry Lorayne  \nA. THOMAS & CO. \nPRESTON  \n\nContents \nForeword  11 \nHow Keen Is Your Observation?  13 \nDoes what you see register in your mind? Which \nlight is on top of the traffic light? Is the number six \non your watch dial, the Arabic #6 or is it the \nRoman #VI? Other observation questions. The \nimportance of observation in memory.  \nHabit Is Memory  20 \nThere is no such thing as a poor memory, only a \ntrained or untrained one. There is no limit to the \ncapacity of the memory. Lucius Scipio was able to \nremember the names of all the people of Rome;  \nSeneca could memorize and repeat two thousand \nwords after hearing them once.  \nTest Your Memory  24 \nIf you can remember any one thing by association,  \nyou can do it with anything else. A series of tests \nfor you to take now to indicate how limited your \nuntrained memory is.  \nInterest in Memory  32 \nThe first step is to be interested in remembering \nnames, faces, dates, figures, facts—anything, and \nthat you have confidence in your ability to retrain \nthem.  \nLink Method of Memory  39 \nWhat the Link Method is. Use this method of \nassociating ridiculous mental images with items \nyou want to remember. Start to remember as \nyou've never remembered before.  \nContents \nPeg System of Memory  48 \nThe Peg System helps you associate and remember \nnumbers. You can learn to remember 52 items by \nnumber, in and out of order.  \nUses of the Peg and Link Systems  60 \nStart with remembering a Shopping List and Daily \nErrands. From this you will go on to more difficult \nfeats. \nHow to Train Your Observation  66 \nTest yourself (and your friends) on a \"trick\" sign. \nHow to sharpen and develop your observation abil- \nities. \nIt Pays to Remember Speeches, Articles, Scripts \nand Anecdotes 72 \nHow to retain the contents of a speech or script JOT \ndelivery or use when wanted.

Substi- \ntute picture words and symbols for names.  \nMore about Names and Faces 139 \nNow test your ability to remember names and \nfaces. Compare your score and your improvement.  \nIt Pays to Remember Facts about People 151 \nThe more you can remember about people you \nmeet, the more success and happiness you will \nhave in your social and business life.  \nIt Pays to Remember Telephone Numbers 157 \nHere's how you will be able to remember any \nnumber of telephone numbers with the greatest \nof ease.  \nThe Importance of Memory 167 \nHow a trained memory helped successful men and \nwomen in their activities and careers.  \nDon't Be Absent-minded 174 \nHow to handle and overcome mental blocks.  \nAmaze Your Friends 181 \nLearn the incredible \"400 digit\" memory feat and \nastound your friends.  \nContents  \nIt Pays to Remember Appointments and Schedules  189 \nAsimple way to keep your daily and weekly ap- \npointments and schedules on your mind. \nIt Pays to Remember Anniversaries, Birthdays and \nOther Important Dates 199 \nHow to apply the methods you have learned to re- \nmember important dates in your life.  \nMemory Demonstrations 205 \nLearn how to memorize the Morse Code in just \nhalf an hour.  \nUse the Systems 212 \nNow, with full confidence, you can remember \nprices, style numbers, state capitals, calories, facts \nand ideas—anything you want to remember.  \nForeword \nmark twain is reported to have said that \"everyone talks \nabout the weather, but no one does anything about it.\" \nSimilarly, everyone talks or brags about their bad memory, \nbut few people ever do anything about it. Let's face it, there \nisn't much you can do about the weather, but there's a \ngreat deal that you can do about your bad memory. \nMany people have told me that they would \"give a mil- \nlion dollars\" if they could acquire a memory like mine. \nWell, don't misunderstand me, I wouldn't turn down your \noffer of a million dollars; but, actually the price of this book \nis all you need to spend. \nThis isn't true in its strictest sense; you'll also have to \nspend just a little bit of your time, and just a little effort \nto get the brain working. Once you've started on my sys- \ntem, you may be surprised as to how simple and obvious it \nreally is. \nIf you purchased this book expecting a theoretical ha- \nrangue of technical terms, you are doomed to disappoint- \nment. I have tried to write and explain the system as if I \nwere sitting in your living room and explaining it to you \nthere. \nAlthough naturally, quite a bit of research was necessary, \nI've discarded most of the technical ideas and thoughts be- \nForeword \ncause I found them difficult to understand and to apply \nmyself. I am an entertainer and a memory expert, not a \npsychiatrist or a doctor, and I didn't think it necessary to \ngo into an explanation of the workings of the human brain, \nand just how the memory actually works in terms of cells, \ncurves, impressions, etc. \nSo you will find that all the ways and methods in the \nbook are those that I use myself and therefore feel quali- \nfied to teach to you. \nPsychologists and educators have said that we use only a \nsmall percentage of our brain power—I think the system \nhere will enable you to use just a little more than average. \nSo, if like your operations, you have been bragging about \nyour poor memory; I think that after you've read this book, \nyou'll still brag about your memory, but to the other ex- \ntreme. Now, you'll be able to boast of possessing a wonder- \nfully retentive and accurate memory! \nHow Keen Is Your Observation  \nWhich light is on top of the traffic light? Is it the Red or the \nGreen? Your first thought, probably is that this is an easy ques- \ntion to answer. However, put yourself in this position—you are \non one of the current quiz shows that pays a lot of money for \ncorrect answers. You must answer this question correctly to win \nthe top prize. Now then, which light is on top, the Red or the \nGreen? \nif you have been able to picture yourself in the above posi- \ntion, you are probably hesitating now, because you're not \nreally sure which light is on top, are you? If you are sure, \nthen you're one of the minority who has observed what \nmost people only see. There is a world of difference be- \ntween seeing and observing; proven, of course, by the fact \nthat most of the people to whom I put the above question, \neither give the wrong answer or are not sure. This, even \nthough they see the traffic lights countless times every day! \nBy the way, Red is always on top of the traffic light, \nGreen is always on the bottom. If there is a third color, it \nis usually Yellow, for caution, and that one is always in the \ncenter. If you were sure that Red was the correct answer, let \nme see if I can't puncture your pride a bit with another ob- \nservation test. \n13 \n14 How Keen Is Your Observation? \nDon't look at your wrist watch! Don't look at your wrist \nwatch, and answer this question:—Is the number six on \nyour watch dial, the Arabic #6, or is it the Roman Numeral \nVI? Think this over for a moment, before you look at your \nwatch. Decide on your answer as if it were really important \nthat you answer correctly. You're on that quiz show again, \nand there's a lot of money at stake. \nAll right, have you decided on your answer? Now, look \nat your watch and see if you were right. Were you? Or \nwere you wrong in either case, because your watch doesn't \nhave a six at all!? The small dial that ticks off the seconds \nusually occupies that space on most modern watches. \nDid you answer this question correctly? Whether you \ndid or did not, you had to look at your watch to check. Can \nyou tell now, the exact time on your watch? Probably not, \nand you just looked at it a second ago! Again, you saw, but \nyou didn't observe. \nTry this on your friends. Although people see their \nwatches innumerable times every day, few of them can tell \nyou about the numeral six. \nHere's another one to try on your friends; but you'd bet- \nter see if you can answer it first. If you are a cigarette \nsmoker, you have seen a blue tax stamp on your pack of \ncigarettes each time you take it out to remove a cigarette. \nOn this tax stamp is the picture of a man, and his name is \nprinted under the picture. \nFor the top prize on our imaginary quiz show, name this \nman! I guess you'll have to leave the quiz show with only \nthe consolation prize. I say this so definitely because only \nabout two or three of the many people I've tested, have \nanswered this one correctly. The man pictured on the reve- \nnue stamp is De Witt Clinton! Check it. \nIdon't want to be sneaky, but if you've just looked at the \nstamp and at the picture of De Witt Clinton, you must \nHow Keen Is Your Observation? 15 \nhave seen what Clinton was doing with his left hand. You \nalso saw, or probably saw, four letters, two on the upper \nleft and two on the upper right of the stamp. I say that you \nsaw these things, I don't think you observed them. If you \ndid, you should be able to tell yourself right now, what \nDe Witt Clinton is doing with his left hand, and also name \nthe four letters. \nHad to look again, didn't you? Now you've observed that \nhis left hand is at Clinton's temple, as if he were thinking, \nand the letters are, U.S.I.R. for United States Internal \nRevenue. \nDon't feel too badly if you couldn't answer any of these \nquestions; as I said before, most people can't. You may \nrecall a motion picture a few years ago which starred Ron- \nald Colman, Celeste Holm and Art Linkletter. The picture \nwas \"Champagne for Caesar,\" and it was about a man who \ncouldn't be stumped with any question on a quiz show. \nThe finale of the film was the last question of the quiz, \nwhich was worth some millions of dollars. To earn these \nmillions, Ronald Colman was asked to give his own social \nsecurity number. Of course, he didn't know it! This was \namusing and interesting, to me, anyway, since it struck \nhome. It proves, doesn't it, that people see but do not ob- \nserve? Incidentally, do you know your social security num- \nber? \nAlthough the systems and methods contained in this \nbook make you observe automatically, you will find some \ninteresting observation exercises in a later chapter. The sys- \ntem will also make you use your imagination with more \nfacility than ever before. \nI've taken the time and space to talk about observation \nbecause it is one of the things important to training your \nmemory. The other, and more important thing, is associa- \ntion. We cannot possibly remember anything that we do \n16 How Keen Is Your Observation?  \nnot observe. After something is observed, either by sight or \nhearing, it must, in order to be remembered, be associated \nin our minds with, or to, something we already know or re- \nmember. \nSince you will observe automatically when using my sys- \ntem, it is association with which we will mostly concern \nourselves. \nAssociation, as pertaining to memory, simply means the \nconnecting or tying up of two (or more) things to each \nother. Anything you manage to remember, or have man- \naged to remember, is only due to the fact that you have \nsubconsciously associated it to something else. \n\"Every Good Boy Does Fine.\" —Does that sentence \nmean anything to you? If it docs, then you must have \nstudied music as a youngster. Almost every child that \nstudies music is taught to remember the lines of the music \nstaff or treble clef, by remembering, \"Every Good Boy Docs \nFine.\" \nI've already stressed the importance of association, and \nIwant to prove to you that you have used definite con- \nscious associations many times before, without even realiz- \ning it. The letters, E, G, B, D and F don't mean a thing. \nThey are just letters, and difficult to remember. The sen- \ntence, \"Every Good Boy Does Fine\" does have meaning, \nand is something you know and understand. The new \nthing, the thing you had to commit to memory was asso- \nciated with something you already knew. \nThe spaces of the music staff were committed to mem- \nory with the same system; the initial system. If you re- \nmembered the word, \"face,\" you remembered that the \nspaces on the staff are, F, A, C, and E. Again you associated \nsomething new and meaningless to something you already \nknew and to something that had meaning to you. \nIt is probably many years since you learned the jinglet, \nHow Keen Is Your Observation?  17 \n\"Thirty days hath September, April, June and November, \nall the rest have thirty-one, etc.,\" but how many times have \nyou relied on it when it was necessary to know the number \nof days in a particular month? \nIf you were ever taught to remember the nonsense word, \n\"vibgyor,\" or the nonsense name, \"Roy B. Giv,\" then you \nstill remember the colors of the spectrum: Red, Orange, \nYellow, Blue, Green, Indigo and Violet. This again is the \nassociation and initial system. \nIam sure that many times you have seen or heard some- \nthing which made you snap your fingers, and say, \"Oh, that \nreminds me. . . .\" You were made to remember something \nby the thing you saw or heard, which usually had no ob- \nvious connection to the thing you remembered. However, \nin your mind, the two things were associated in some way. \nThis was a subconscious association. Right now, I am point- \ning out a few examples of conscious associations at work; \nand they certainly do work. People who have forgotten \nmany things that they learned in their early grades, still \nremember the spaces and lines of the treble clef. If yon \nhave read this chapter so far, concentrating as you read, \nyou should know them by now, even if you've never studied \nmusic. \nOne of the best examples I know, is the one which was \nagreat help to me in my early grade spelling classes. We \nwere being taught that the word, \"believe\" was spelled with \nthe e following the i. In order to help us to commit this to \nmemory, we were told to remember a short sentence, \n\"Never believe a lie.\" \nThis is a perfect instance of a conscious association. I \nknow for a fact that many adults still have trouble spelling, \n\"believe.\" They are never quite sure if the i is first, or if it \nis the e. The spelling of the word, \"believe\" was the new \nthing to remember. The word, \"lie\" is a word we all already \n18 How Keen Is Your Observation?  \nknew how to spell. None of the students that heard that \nlittle sentence, ever again misspelled the word, \"believe.\" \nDo you have trouble spelling the word, \"piece\"? If you do, \njust remember the phrase, \"piece of pie.\" This phrase will \nalways tell you how to spell, \"piece.\" \nCan you draw anything that resembles the map of Eng- \nland, from memory? How about China, Japan or Czecho- \nslovakia? You probably can't draw any of these. If I had \nmentioned Italy, ninety percent of you would have imme- \ndiately seen a picture of a boot in your mind's eye. Is that \nright? If you did, and if you draw a boot, you will have the \napproximate outline of the map of Italy. \nWhy did this picture appear in your mind's eye? Only \nbecause, at one time or another, perhaps many years ago, \nyou either heard or noticed that the map of Italy resembled \naboot. The shape of Italy, of course, was the new thing to \nremember; the boot was the something we already knew \nand remembered. \nYou can see that simple conscious associations helped \nyou memorize abstract information like the above examples \nvery easily. The initial system that I mentioned earlier, can \nbe used to help you memorize many things. For example, \nif you wanted to remember the names of the Dionne quin- \ntuplets, you could try to remember the word, \"macey.\" This \nwould help you to recall that the girls' names are, Marie, \nAnnette, Cecile, Emilie and Yvonne. \nThere's only one thing wrong with this idea in its present \nstage. There is nothing to make you remember that the \nword, \"macey\" is connected with the Dionne quintuplets, \nor vice versa. \nIf you remembered the word; fine, then you would prob- \nably know the names of the quints; but, how do you re- \nmember the word? I'll show you how to do this in future \nchapters. \nHow Keen Is Your Observation? 19 \nThe systems and methods in this book will show you how \nthe principles and ideas of simple conscious associations \ncan be applied to remembering anything. Yes, that's right— \nremembering anything, including names and faces, items, \nobjects, facts, figures, speeches, etc. In other words, the sys- \ntems and methods you will learn in this book, can be ap- \nplied to anything and everything in every day social or busi- \nness life. \nHabit Is Memory  \nIfeel assured that there is no such thing as ultimate forgetting; \ntraces once impressed upon the memory are indestructible.  \n—Thomas De Quincey  \nan accurate and retentive memory is the basis of all busi- \nness success. In the last analysis, all our knowledge is based \non our memories. Plato said it this way, \"All knowledge is \nbut rememberance\"; while Cicero said of memory, it is \"the \ntreasury and guardian of all things.\" One strong example \nshould suffice for the time being—you could not be reading \nthis book right now, if you didn't remember the sounds of \nthe twenty-six letters of our alphabet! \nThis may seem a bit far fetched to you, but it is true, \nnevertheless. Actually, if you were to lose your memory \ncompletely, you would have to start learning everything \nfrom scratch, just like a new born baby. You wouldn't re- \nmember how to dress, or shave, or apply your makeup, or \nhow to drive your car, or whether to use a knife or fork, etc. \nYou see, all the things we attribute to habit, should be \nattributed to memory. Habit is memory. \nMnemonics, which is a large part of a trained memory, is \nnot a new or strange thing. As a matter of fact, the word, \n\"mnemonic\" is derived from the name of the Greek God-  \n20 \nHabit Is Memory 21 \ndess, Mnemosyne; and, memory systems were used as far \nback as early Greek civilization. The strange thing is that \ntrained memory systems are not known and used by many \nmore people. Most of those who have learned the secret \nof mnemonics in memory, have been amazed, not only at \ntheir own tremendous ability to remember, but also at the \nkudos they received from their families and friends. \nSome of them decided it was too good a thing to teach to \nanyone else. Why not be the only man at the office who \ncould remember every style number and price; why not be \nthe only one who could get up at a party, and demonstrate \nsomething that everyone marvelled at? \nI, on the other hand, feel that trained memories should \nbe brought to the foreground, and to this end—this book \nis dedicated. Although some of you may know me as an \nentertainer, it is not my purpose, of course, to teach you a \nmemory act. I have no desire to put you on the stage. I do \nwant to teach you the wonderful practical uses of a trained \nmemory. There are many memory stunts taught in this \nbook; these are fine for showing your friends how bright \nyou are. More important, they are excellent memory exer- \ncises, and the ideas used in all the stunts can be applied \npractically. \nThe question that people ask me most often, is, \"Isn't it \nconfusing to remember too much?\" My answer to that is, \n\"No!\" There is no limit to the capacity of the memory. \nLucius Scipio was able to remember the names of all the \npeople of Rome; Cyrus was able to call every soldier in his \narmy by name; while Seneca could memorize and repeat \ntwo thousand words, after hearing them once. \nIbelieve that the more you remember, the more you can \nremember. The memory, in many ways, is like a muscle. A \nmuscle must be exercised and developed in order to give \nproper service and use; so must the memory. The difference \n22 Habit Is Memory  \nis that a muscle can be overtrained or become musclebound \nwhile the memory cannot. You can be taught to have a \ntrained memory just as you can be taught anything else. \nAs a matter of fact, it is much easier to attain a trained \nmemory than, say, to learn to play a musical instrument. If \nyou can read and write English, and have a normal amount \nof common sense, and if you read and study this book, you \nwill have acquired a trained memory! Along with the \ntrained memory you will probably acquire a greater power \nof concentration, a purer sense of observation, and perhaps, \nastronger imagination.  \nRemember please, that there is no such thing as a bad \nmemory! This may come as a shock to those of you who \nhave used your supposedly \"bad\" memories as an excuse for \nyears. But, I repeat, there is no such thing as a bad memory. \nThere are only trained or untrained memories. Almost all \nuntrained memories are one-sided. That is to say that peo- \nple who can remember names and faces, cannot remember \ntelephone numbers, and those who remember phone num- \nbers, can't, for the life of them, remember the names of the \npeople they wish to call.  \nThere are those who have a pretty good retentive mem- \nory, but a painfully slow one; just as there are some who \ncan remember things quickly, but cannot retain them for \nany length of time. If you apply the systems and methods \ntaught in this book, I can assure you a quick and retentive \nmemory for just about anything.  \nAs I mentioned in the previous chapter, anything you \nwish to remember must in some way or other, be asso- \nciated in your mind to something you already know or re- \nmember. Of course, most of you will say that you have \nremembered, or do remember, many things, and that you \ndo not associate them with anything else. Very true! If you \nHabit Is Memory 23 \nwere associating knowingly, then you would already have \nthe beginnings of a trained memory.  \nYou see, most of the things you have ever remembered, \nhave been associated subconsciously with something else \nthat you already knew or remembered. The important word \nhere, is, \"subconsciously.\" You yourselves do not realize \nwhat is going on in your subconscious; most of us would \nbe frightened if we did. What you subconsciously associ- \nated strongly, will be remembered, what was not associated \nstrongly, will be forgotten. Since this tiny mental calisthenic \ntakes place without your knowledge, you cannot help it any.  \nHere then is the crux of the matter—I am going to teach \nyou to associate anything you want to, consciously! When \nyou have learned to do that, you will have acquired a \ntrained memory!  \nKeep in mind that the system that I teach in this book \nis an aid to your normal or true memory. It is your true \nmemory that does the work for you, whether you realize \nit or not. There is a very thin line between a trained mem- \nory and the true memory, and as you continue to use the \nsystem taught here, that line will begin to fade.  \nThat is the wonderful part about the whole thing; after \nusing my system consciously for a while—it becomes auto- \nmatic and you almost start doing it subconsciouslyl  \nTest Your Memory  \nSome college students were taking an examination just prior to \ntheir Christmas vacation. This was an exam they hadn't looked \nforward to, since they knew it would be a tough one. It was!  \nOne student handed in his paper with this remark on it: \n\"God only knows the answers to these questions. Merry Christ- \nmas!\"  \nThe professor marked the papers, and returned them to the \nstudents. One had a message on it: \"God gets an A, you get \nan F. Happy New Year!\"  \nIDON'Tthink you'll find the tests in this chapter quite as \ndifficult. Even if you do, it doesn't matter, since no one will \nknow how badly you do on them. In a previous chapter, I \ngave you a few examples showing how conscious associa- \ntions are a great help in remembering anything. Such a sim- \nple aid to our memories, and yet so effective. The fact that \nthose of you who learned the phrase, \"Never believe a lie\" \nnever misspelled the word, \"believe\" again, proves their \neffectiveness. The more important fact that you can retain \nthese simple associations over a period of years, proves it \nstill more.  \nIt is my contention that if you can remember or retain \none thing with the aid of a conscious association, you can \ndo it with anything else. That's my contention and I intend  \n24 \nTest Your Memory  25  \nto prove it with you; I also intend to prove it to you. After \nyou've learned the methods, I'm sure you'll agree that con- \nscious associations will be more useful and valuable to you \nthan you ever imagined they could be. If I were to tell you \nnow, that after reading and studying the system in this \nbook, you would be able to remember as high as a fifty digit \nnumber, and retain it for as long as you liked, after looking \nat it only once—you would think me mad.  \nIf I told you that you could memorize the order of a \nshuffled deck of fifty-two playing cards after hearing them \ncalled only once, you would think me mad! If I told you \nthat you would never again be troubled by forgetting names \nor faces, or that you would be able to remember a shopping \nlist of fifty items, or memorize the contents of an entire \nmagazine, or remember prices and important telephone \nnumbers, or know the day of the week of any date—you \nwould surely think I had \"flipped my lid.\" But read and \nstudy this book, and see for yourself!  \nIimagine that the best way for me to prove it to you is \nto let you see your own progress. In order to do that, I must \nshow you first how poor your untrained memory is. So take \nafew moments out, right now, and mark yourselves on the \ntests that follow. In this way you will be able to take the \nsame tests after reading certain chapters, and compare your \nscores.  \nIfeel that these tests are quite important. Since your \nmemory will improve with almost every chapter you read, I \nwant you to see that improvement. That will give you confi- \ndence, which in itself is important to a trained memory. \nAfter each test you will find a space for your present score, \nand a space which is to be used for your score after reading \nthose particular chapters.  \nOne important point, before you take the tests—don't \nflip through the book and read only the chapters that you  \n26 Test Your Memory  \nthink will help you. All the chapters will help you, and it is \nmuch better if you read from one to the other. Do not jump \nahead, ofme, or yourself!  \nTest #1  \nRead this list of fifteen objects just once—you can take about \ntwo minutes to do so. Then try to write them, without looking \nat the book, of course, in exactly the same order in which they \nappear here. When scoring yourself, remember that if you leave \nout a word, that will make the remaining words incorrect, for \nthey will be out of sequence. I will remind you to take this test \nagain, after you've read Chapter 5. Give yourself 5 points for \neach correct one.  \nbook, ashtray, cow, coat, match, razor, apple, purse, Venetian \nblind, frying pan, clock, eyeglasses, door knob, bottle, worm.  \nWrite your score here —.     Score after learning Chapter 5 —.  \nTest #2 \nTake about three minutes to try to memorize the twenty ob- \njects listed here, by number. Then try to list them yourself with- \nout looking at the book. You must remember not only the ob- \nject, but to which number it belongs. You'll be reminded to take \nthis test again, after you've read Chapter 6. Give yourself 5 \npoints for every object that you put with the correct number.  \n1. radio  6. telephone 11 .dress 16. bread \n2. airplane 7. chair 12. flowei 17. pencil \n3.lamp                        8. horse                   13. window 18. curtain \n \n4. cigarette 9. egg 14. perfume 19. vase \n5. picture   10. tea cup 15. book 20. hat \nWrite your score here —.     Score after learning Chapter 6 —.  \nTest #3  \nLook at this twenty digit number for about two and a half \nminutes, then take a piece of paper and try to write it from \nmemory. Give yourself 5 points for every number that you put \ndown in its correct place or sequence. Understand please, that  \nTest Your Memory . 27 \nthe important thing here is retentiveness, which you cannot test \nuntil you have read Chapter 11. \n72443278622173987651 \nWrite your score here —.     Score after learning Chapter 11 —. \nTest #4  \nImagine that someone has taken five cards out of a shuffled \ndeck of playing cards. Now the rest of the cards (47) are called \noff to you just once. Could you tell, by memory, which five were \nnot called, or were missing? Let's try it. Look down this list of \nforty-seven cards only once. After you've done so, take a pencil \nand jot down the names of the five cards that you think are \nmissing.

First, of course, as I stated above, \nthat you would be able to see your own progress as you read \nthrough this book. Also, to show you how unreliable an un- \ntrained memory really is. \nIt does not take a lot of work and study to be able to get \n100% on all these tests. I like to refer to the system in this book \nas the \"lazy man's\" way of remembering! \nInterest in Memory  \nThe true art of memory is the art of attention. \n—Samuel Johnson \nplease read the following paragraph very carefully:— \nYou are driving a bus which contains fifty people. The bus \nmakes one stop and ten people get off, while three people get on. \nAt the next stop seven people get off the bus, and two people \nget on. There are two more stops at which four passengers get \noff each time, and three fares get on at one stop, and none at \nthe other. At this point, the bus has to stop because of mechani- \ncal trouble. Some of the passengers are in a hurry and decide to \nwalk. So eight people get off the bus. When the mechanical \ntrouble is taken care of, the bus goes to the last stop, and the \nrest of the people get off. \nNow, without re-reading the paragraph, see if you can \nanswer two questions about it. I feel pretty sure that if I \nasked you to tell me how many people were left on the \nbus, or how many got off the bus at the last stop, you would \nhave the answer immediately. However, one of the ques- \ntions I want you to answer is:— How many stops did the \nbus make altogether? \nImay be wrong, but I don't think that many of you can \nanswer this question. The reason, of course, is that you all \nfelt sure that the question I would ask, after you read the \n32 \nInterest in Memory  33 \nparagraph, would pertain to the amount of people. There- \nfore you gave your attention to the amount of people that \nwere getting on and off the bus. You were interested in the \namount of people. In short, you wanted to know or remem- \nber how many people would be left on the bus. Since you \ndidn't think that the number of stops was important, you \ndidn't pay much attention to that. You weren't interested \nin the amount of stops, therefore they didn't register in \nyour mind at all, and you didn't remember them. \nHowever, if some of you did feel that the amount of stops \nwas important or if you felt you would be questioned on \nthat particular point; then you surely did know the answer \nto my first question, or remembered the number of stops \nthat the bus made. Again, simply because you were inter- \nested or wanted to know that particular information. \nIf you feel elated because you did answer my question; \ndon't. Because I doubt if you will answer the second one. A \ngood friend of mine who is employed at Grossingers, a large \nresort hotel, at which I perform quite often, uses this in his \nafternoon quizzes. I know that a very small percentage of \nthe guests ever answer this correctly, if at all. Without look- \ning at that first paragraph again, you're to answer this ques- \ntion:— What is the bus driver's name? \nAs I said, I doubt if any of you can answer this correctly, \nif at all. Actually, this is more of a trick question on observa- \ntion than it is a memory test. I use it here only to impress \nupon you the importance of interest in memory. Had I told \nyou before you read that \"bus\" story, that I would ask for \nthe driver's name—you would have been interested in the \nname. You'd have wanted to notice and remember it. \nEven so, it is sort of a tricky question, and you may not \nhave been observant enough to be able to answer it. This, \nincidentally, is a principle that many professional magicians \nhave been using for years. It is called \"misdirection.\" It \n34 Interest in Memory  \nsimply means that the important move in a trick, the move \nthat actually is the \"modus operandi,\" is kept in the back- \nground. Or, it is covered with another move, one that has \nnothing to do with the trick, but which you are led to be- \nlieve is the important move. This is the move that you will \nobserve and remember. The one that actually worked the \ntrick is not even noticed, and that is why you are completely \nfooled. Most people, when describing a magician's trick, \nwill make the effect so impossible that if the magician him- \nself were listening, he wouldn't believe it. Only because \nthey leave out the all important move in their description. \nAside from \"box\" tricks, or tricks that mechanically work \nthemselves, magicians would have a tough time fooling \ntheir audiences if it weren't for the art of \"misdirection.\" \nWell, I \"misdirected\" you by making you think I was \ngoing to ask about one thing, and then I asked about some- \nthing you didn't even notice. I guess I've kept you in sus- \npense long enough. You probably are anxious to know the \nanswer to my second question. Well, actually the first word \nof the paragraph tells you who the driver is. The first word \nof the paragraph is, \"you.\" The correct answer to the ques- \ntion, \"What is the bus driver's name?\", is your own name! \nYou were driving the bus. Try this one on your friends and \nsee how few of them can answer it correctly. \nAs I've said, this is more of an observation test than a \nmemory test. But memory and observation do go hand in \nhand. You cannot possibly remember anything you do not \nobserve; and it is extremely difficult to observe or remember \nanything that you do not want to remember, or that you \nare not interested in remembering. \nThis, of course, leads to an obvious memory rule. If you \nwant to improve your memory immediately, force yourself \nto want to remember. Force yourself to be interested \nenough to observe anything you want to remember or re- \nInterest in Memory  35 \ntain. I say, \"force yourself,\" because at first a little effort \nmay be necessary; however in an amazingly short time, \nyou'll find that there is no effort at all required to make \nyourself want to remember anything. The fact that you \nare reading this book, is your first forward step. You \nwouldn't be reading it if you didn't want to remember, \nor if you weren't interested in improving your memory. \n\"Without motivation there can hardly be remembrance.\" \nAside from intending to remember, confidence that you \nwill remember is also helpful. If you tackle any memory \nproblem with the thought, \"I will remember\"; more often \nthan not, you will. Think of your memory as a sieve. Each \ntime that you feel or say, \"I have an awful memory,\" or, \n\"I'll never be able to remember this,\" you put another hole \nin the sieve. If, on the other hand, you say, \"I have a won- \nderful memory,\" or, \"I'll remember this easily,\" you're \nplugging up one of those holes. \nAlot of people I know, invariably ask me why they \ncan't remember a thing, even though they write down every- \nthing they wish to remember. Well, that's like asking why \nthey can't swim well, even though they tie a twenty pound \nstone around their necks. The very fact that they do write \nit, is probably why they forget; or rather, why they didn't \nremember in the first place. As far as I'm concerned, the \nphrase, \"I forgot\" should not be in the language. It should \nbe, \"I didn't remember in the first place.\" \nYou cannot forget anything you ever really remembered. \nIf you were to write things down with the intent of aiding \nyour memory, or with the conscious thought of helping you \nto be exact with the information, that would be fine. How- \never, using pencil and paper as a substitute for memory \n(which most people do), is certainly not going to improve \nit. Your handwriting may improve, or the speed of your \nwriting might improve, but your memory will get worse \n56 Interest in Memory \nthrough neglect and non-use. You see, you usually write \nthings down only because you refuse or are too lazy to take \nthe slight effort or time to remember. Oliver Wendell \nHolmes put it this way: \"A man must get a thing before \nhe can forget it.\" \nPlease keep in mind that the memory likes to be trusted. \nThe more you trust it the more reliable and useful it will \nbecome. Writing everything down on paper without trying \nto remember, is going against all the basic rules for a \nstronger and better memory. You're not trusting your mem- \nory; you haven't the confidence in your memory; you're not \nexercising the memory, and your interest is not strong \nenough to retain it, if you must write it down. Remember \nthat you can always lose your paper or notebook, but not \nyour mind. If I may be allowed a small attempt at humor, \nif you do lose your mind, it doesn't matter much if you \nremember or not, does it? \nSeriously, if you are interested in remembering, if you \nhave confidence that you will remember, you have no need \nto write everything down. How many parents continually \ncomplain that their children have terrible memories, be- \ncause they can't remember their school work, and conse- \nquently get poor marks? Yet, some of these same children \ncan remember the batting averages of every baseball player \nin the major leagues. They know all the rules of baseball; or \nwho made what great play in what year for which team, etc. \nIf they can remember these facts and figures so easily and \nso well, why can't some of them retain their lessons at \nschool? Only because they are more interested in baseball \nthan they are in algebra, history, geography and other \nschool subjects. \nThe problem is not with their memories, but with their \nlack of interest. The proof of the pudding is in the fact that \nmost children excel in at least one particular subject, even \nInterest in Memory  27 \nthough they have poor marks in all the others. If a student \nhas a good memory for one subject, he is a good student in \nthat subject. If he can't remember, or has a poor memory \nin that subject, he will be a poor student in that subject. \nIt's as simple as that. However, this proves that the student \ndoes have a good memory for things that he likes, or is \ninterested in. \nMany of you who went through High School had to take \naforeign language or two. Do you still remember these \nlanguages? I doubt it. If you've travelled in foreign coun- \ntries, or to places where they speak these particular lan- \nguages, you've wished many times that you had paid more \nattention in shcool. Of course, if you knew that you were \ngoing to travel to these places, when you were in school, \nyou would have been interested in learning the language; \nyou would have wanted to do so. You'd have been amazed \nto find how much better your marks would have been. I \nknow that this is true in my case. If I had known then that \nIwould want to know these languages, I'd have learned \nand/or remembered much more easily. Unfortunately, I \ndidn't have a trained memory then. \nMany women will complain that their memories are \natrocious, and that they can't remember a thing. These \nsame women will describe and remember in detail what a \nlady friend was wearing when they met weeks ago. They \nusually can spot another woman in a car travelling up to \nforty miles an hour, and tell you what she's wearing; the \ncolors, her style of hairdo; whether the hair was natural or \nbleached, and the woman's approximate age! \nThey'll probably even know how much money this \nwoman had. This, of course, goes out of the realm of mem- \nory and starts to touch on psychic powers. The important \nthing, the thing that I have been trying to stress in this \nchapter, is that interest is of great importance to memory. \n38 Interest in Memory  \nIf you can remember things that you are interested in to \nsuch a tremendous degree, it proves that you do have a \ngood memory. It also proves that if you were as interested \nin other things, you would be able to remember them just \nas well. \nThe thing to do is to make up your mind that you will \nbe interested in remembering names, faces, dates, figures, \nfacts—anything; and that you will have confidence in your \nability to retain them. This, alone, without the actual sys- \ntems and methods of associations in this book, will improve \nyour memory to a noticeable degree. With the systems of \nassociation as an aid to your true memory, you are on your \nway to an amazingly remarkable and retentive memory. \nYou can start to prove this to yourself in the next chapter. \nLink Method of Memory  \nAman's real possession is his memory. In nothing else is he rich, \nin nothing else is he poor. \n—Alexander Smith  \nIwant  to show you now, that you can start, immediately, \nto remember as you've never remembered before. I don't \nbelieve that anyone with an untrained memory can pos- \nsibly remember twenty unassociated items, in sequence, \nafter hearing or seeing them only once. Even though you \ndon't believe it either, you will accomplish just that if you \nread and study this chapter. \nBefore going into the actual memorizing, I must explain \nthat your trained memory will be based almost entirely on \nmental pictures or images. These mental pictures will be \neasily recalled if they are made as ridiculous as you can \npossibly make them. Here are the twenty items that you \nwill be able to memorize in sequence in a surprisingly short \ntime. \ncarpet, paper, bottle, bed, fish, chair, window, telephone, \ncigarette, nail, typewriter, shoe, microphone, pen, television set, \nplate, donut, car, coffee pot, and brick. \nAfamous man once said that method is the mother of \nmemory. So, I'll teach you now, what I call the Link \nmethod of memory. I've told you that your trained memory \n39 \n40 Link Method of Memory \nwill consist mostly of ridiculous mental images, so let's \nmake ridiculous mental images of the above twenty items! \nDon't be alarmed! It is child's play; as a matter of fact it \nis almost like a game. \nThe first thing you have to do is to get a picture of the \nfirst item, \"carpet,\" in your mind. You all know what a \ncarpet is—so just \"see\" it in your mind's eye. Don't just see \nthe word, \"carpet,\" but actually, for a second, sec either any \ncarpet, or, a carpet that is in your own home and is there- \nfore familiar to you. I have already told you that in order \nto remember anything, it must be associated in some way to \nsomething you already know or remember. You are going \nto do that right now, and the items themselves will serve \nas the things you already remember. The thing that you \nnow know or already remember is the item, \"carpet.\" The \nnew thing, the thing you want to remember will be the \nsecond item, \"paper.\" \nNow then, here is your first and most important step \ntowards your trained memory. You must now associate or \nlink carpet to, or with, paper. The association must be as \nridiculous as possible. For example, you might picture the \ncarpet in your home made out of paper. See yourself walk- \ning on it, and actually hearing the paper crinkle under foot. \nYou can picture yourself writing something on a carpet \ninstead of paper. Either one of these is a ridiculous picture \nor association. A sheet of paper lying on a carpet would not \nmake a good association. It is too logical! Your mental pic- \nture must be ridiculous or illogical. Take my word for the \nfact that if your association is a logical one, you will not \nremember it. \nNow, here is the point which I will keep reminding you \nof throughout this book. You must actually see this ridicu- \nlous picture in your mind for a fraction of a second. Please \ndo not just try to see the words, but definitely see the pic- \nLink Method of Memory  41 \nture you've decided on. Close your eyes for a second; that \nmight make it easier to see the picture, at first. As soon as \nyou see it, stop thinking about it and go on to your next \nstep. The thing you now already know or remember is, \n\"paper,\" therefore the next step is to associate or Link, \npaper to the next item on the list, which is, \"bottle.\" At this \npoint, you pay no attention to \"carpet\" any longer. Make \nan entirely new ridiculous mental picture with, or between \nbottle and paper. You might see yourself reading a gigantic \nbottle instead of a paper, or writing on a gigantic bottle \ninstead of on paper. Or, you might picture a bottle pouring \npaper out of its mouth instead of liquid; or a bottle made \nout of paper instead of glass. Pick the association which \nyou think is most ridiculous and see it in your mind's eye \nfor a moment. \nIcannot stress, too much, the necessity of actually see- \ning this picture in your mind's eye, and making the mental \nimage as ridiculous as possible. You are not, however, to \nstop and think for fifteen minutes to find the most illogical \nassociation; the first ridiculous one that comes to mind is \nusually the best to use. I'll give you two or more ways in \nwhich you might form your pictures with each pair of the \ntwenty items. You are to pick the one that you think is \nmost ridiculous, or one that you've thought of yourself, \nand use that one association only. \nWe have already linked carpet to paper, and then paper \nto bottle. We now come to the next item which is, \"bed.\" \nYou must make a ridiculous association between bottle and \nbed. A bottle lying on a bed, or anything like that would be \ntoo logical. So you might picture yourself sleeping in a large \nbottle instead of a bed, or you might see yourself taking a \nsnort from a bed instead of a bottle. (I can get pretty ridicu- \nlous.) See either of these pictures in your mind for a mo- \nment, then stop thinking of it. \n42 Link Method of Memory \nYou realize, of course, that we are always associating the \nprevious object to the present object. Since we have just \nused, \"bed\"; this is the previous, or the thing we already \nknow and remember. The present object, or the new thing \nthat we want to remember, is \"fish.\" So—make a ridiculous \nassociation or link between bed and fish. You could \"see\" a \ngiant fish sleeping in your bed; or a bed made out of a gigan- \ntic fish. See the picture you think is most ridiculous. \nNow—\"fish\" and \"chair\"—see the gigantic fish sitting on \nachair, or a large fish being used as a chair. Or, you're \ncatching chairs instead of fish while fishing. \nChair and Window—See yourself sitting on a pane of \nglass (which gives you a pain) instead of a chair. Or, you \nmight see yourself violently throwing chairs through a \nclosed window. See the picture before going on to the next \none. \nWindow and Telephone—See yourself answering the \nphone, but when you put it to your ear, it's not a phone \nyou're holding, but a window. Or, you might see your win- \nLink Method of Memory  43 \ndow as a large telephone dial, and you have to lift the dial \nto look out the window. You could see yourself sticking \nyour hand through a window pane in order to pick up the \nphone. See the picture you think is most ridiculous, for a \nmoment. \nTelephone and Cigarette—You're smoking a telephone \ninstead of a cigarette; or you're holding a large cigarette to \nyour ear and talking into it instead of a telephone. Or, you \nmight see yourself picking up the phone and a million ciga- \nrettes fly out of the mouthpiece and hit you in the face. \nCigarette and Nail—You're smoking a nail; or hammer- \ning a lit cigarette into the wall instead of a nail. \nNail and Typewriter—You're hammering a gigantic nail \nright through a typewriter, or all the keys on your type- \nwriter are nails and they're pricking your fingertips as you \ntype- \nTypewriter and Shoe—See yourself wearing typewriters \ninstead of shoes, or you're typing with your shoes. You \nmight want to see a large shoe with keys and you're typing \non that. \nShoe and Microphone—You're wearing microphones in- \nstead of shoes, or, you're broadcasting into a large shoe. \nMicrophone and Pen—You're writing with a microphone \ninstead of a pen, or you're broadcasting and talking into a \ngiant pen. \nPen and Television set—You could \"see\" a million pens \ngushing out of the television screen, or pens performing on \ntelevision, or there is a screen on a gigantic pen and you're \n(I can't resist this pun) watch-ink a television show on it. \nTelevision set and Plate—Picture your television screen \nas one of your kitchen plates, or see yourself eating out of \nthe television set instead of out of a plate, or—you're eating \nout of a plate, and seeing a television show in the plate \nwhile you eat. \n44 Link Method of Memory \nPlate and Donut—\"See\" yourself biting into a donut, \nbut it cracks in your mouth for it's a plate. Or, picture being \nserved dinner in a gigantic donut instead of a plate. \nDonut and Automobile—You can \"see\" a large donut \ndriving an automobile; or, see yourself driving a gigantic \ndonut instead of a car. \nAutomobile and Coffee Pot—A large coffee pot is driving \nacar, or you're driving a gigantic coffee pot instead of a \ncar. You might picture your car on your stove, with coffee \nperking in it. \nCoffee Pot and Brick—See yourself pouring steaming \ncoffee from a brick instead of a coffee pot, or \"see\" bricks \npouring from the spout of a coffee pot instead of coffee. \nThat's it! If you have actually \"seen\" these mental pic- \ntures in your mind's eye, you will have no trouble remem- \nbering the twenty items in sequence, from \"carpet\" to \n\"brick.\" Of course, it takes many times the length of time \nto explain this than to simply do it. Each mental association \nmust be seen for just the smallest fraction of a second, \nbefore going on to the next one. \nLet's see now if you have remembered all the items. If \nyou were to \"see\" a carpet, what would that bring to mind \nimmediately? Why, paper, of course. You saw yourself \nwriting on a carpet, instead of paper. Now, paper brings \nbottle to mind, because you saw a bottle made of paper. \nYou saw yourself sleeping in a gigantic bottle instead of a \nbed; the bed had a gigantic fish sleeping on it; you were \nfishing, and catching chairs and you were flinging chairs \nthrough your closed window. Try it! You will see that you \nwill go right through all the items without missing or for- \ngetting any of them. \nFantastic?? Unbelievable?? Yes! But, as you can see, \nentirely plausible and possible. Why not try making your \nLink Method of Memory  45 \nown list of objects and memorizing them in the way that \nyou have just learned. \nIrealize, of course, that we have all been brought up to \nthink logically, and here I am, telling you to make illogical \nor ridiculous pictures. I know that with some of you, this \nmay be a bit of a problem, at first. You may have a little \ndifficulty in making those ridiculous pictures. However, \nafter doing it for just a little while, the first picture that \ncomes to mind will be a ridiculous or illogical one. Until \nthat happens, here are four simple rules to help you. \n1. Picture your items out of proportion. In other words, \ntoo large. In my sample associations for the above items, I \nused the word, \"gigantic\" quite often. This was to make \nyou get the items out of proportion. \n2. Picture your items in action whenever possible. Unfor- \ntunately, it is the violent and embarrassing things that we \nall remember; much more so than the pleasant things. If \nyou've ever been acutely embarrassed, or been in an acci- \ndent, no matter how many years ago, you don't need a \ntrained memory to remember it vividly. You still squirm \nabit whenever you think of that embarrassing incident that \nhappened years ago, and you probably can still describe in \ndetail the facts of your accident. So get violent action into \nyour association whenever you can. \n3. Exaggerate the amount of items. In my sample asso- \nciation between telephone and cigarette, I told you that you \nmight see millions of cigarettes flying out of the mouth- \npiece, and hitting you in the face. If you saw the cigarettes \nlit and burning your face, you'd have both action and \nexaggeration in your picture. \n4. Substitute your items. This is the one that I, per- \nsonally, use most often. It is simply picturing one item \ninstead of another, i.e. Smoking a nail instead of a cigarette. \n46 Link Method of Memory  \n1. Out of Proportion. 2. Action. 3. Exaggeration. 4. Sub- \nstitution. \nTry to get one or more of the above into your pictures, \nand with a little practice you'll find that a ridiculous asso- \nciation for any two items will come to mind instantly. The \nobjects to be remembered are actually linked one to the \nother, forming a chain, and that is why I call this the Link \nmethod of remembering. The entire Link method boils \ndown to this:—Associate the first item to the second, the \nsecond to the third, third to the fourth, and so on. Make \nyour associations as ridiculous and/or illogical as possible, \nand most important, SEE the pictures in your mind's eye. \nIn later chapters you will learn some practical applica- \ntions of the Link system—how it can help you to recall \nyour daily schedule or errands, and how you can use it to \nhelp you remember speeches. The Link system is also used \nto help memorize long digit numbers and many other \nthings. However, don't jump ahead of yourself; don't \nworry about those things now. \nOf course, you can use the Link immediately to help \nyou remember shopping lists, or to showoff for your friends. \nIf you want to try this as a memory stunt, have your friend \ncall off a list of objects; have him write them down so that \nhe can check you. If when you try this you find that you \nare having trouble recalling the first item, I suggest that you \nassociate that item to the person that's testing you. For \nexample, if \"carpet\" were the first item, you could \"see\" \nyour friend rolled up in your carpet. Also, if on first trying \nthis as a stunt, you do forget one of the items, ask what it \nis and strengthen that particular association. You either \ndidn't use a ridiculous enough association, or you didn't \nsee it in your mind, or you would not have forgotten it. \nAfter you've strengthened your original association, you'll \nLink Method of Memory  47 \nbe able to rattle off the items from first to last. Try it \nand see! \nThe most impressive part of it, is that if your friend asks \nyou to call off the items two or three hours later, you will \nbe able to do it! They will still be brought to mind by \nyour original associations. If you really want to impress \nyour listeners, call the items off backwards! In other words, \nfrom the last item called, right up to the first one. \nAmazingly enough, this works for you automatically. Just \nthink of the last item, that will recall the next to last item, \nand so on down, or rather, up the line. \nBy the way, why not try Test # 1 in Chapter # 3 again. \nCompare your score now, with the score you had before \nyou read this chapter on the Link method. \nPeg System of Memory  \nAcertain organization, whose membership consisted of gag- \nwriters only, was having its annual dinner at a swank hotel in \nNew York City. One of the membership rules of the organiza- \ntion was that the members would never actually tell a joke or a \ngag to each other. They had memorized all the standard gags by \nnumbers, and instead of telling the joke, they would save time \nby simply calling the number of that particular one. \nDuring the dinner, as a situation would present itself, and any \nof the comedy writers thought of a gag to fit the situation, he \nwould call the number, and shouts of laughter would invariably \ngo up. \"Number 148,\" called one—peals of laughter. \"Number \n204,\" shouted another—more laughter. Towards the end of the \ndinner, one of the new members shouted \"Number 212,\" and \nwas greeted by a loud silence. Whereupon his neighbor turned \nto him and said, \"You'll soon learn, my friend, that it's not the \njoke that's important, but the way you tell it.\" \nAlthough the above is pure fiction, most people would \nsay it is impossible to remember so many jokes by number. \nLet me assure you that it is possible, and I will teach you \nhow, in a later chapter. First, however, you must learn \nhow to remember the numbers. Numbers themselves are \nabout the most difficult things to remember because they \nare completely abstract and intangible. It is almost impossi- \nble to picture a number. They are geometric designs and \n48 \nPeg System of Memory  49 \nthey mean nothing in our minds, unless they have been \nassociated to something you know, over a period of time. \nOf course, your own address or your own telephone number \ndoes mean something to you. The problem is to be able to \nassociate any and all numbers easily, quickly, and at any \ntime. \nIf you were to try to hang a painting on your bare living \nroom wall, what would happen? Why, the painting would \nfall to the floor, of course. However, if you had a tiny peg \nin that wall, then you would be able to hang the painting \non it. What I'm going to do is to give you some \"pegs\"; no, \nnot for your wall—but to keep in your mind, always. Any- \nthing you wish to remember from now on, having to do \nwith numbers in any way, you will be able to \"hang\" on \nthese pegs! That is why I call this the PEG system of \nmemory. \nThe PEG system will show you how to count with \nobjects (which can be pictured) instead of numbers. This \nis not a particularly new thought. It was first introduced by \nStanislaus Mink von Wennsshein along about the year \n1648. In the year 1730, the entire system was modified by \nDr. Richard Grey, of England, who called the idea, letter \nor \"number equivalents.\" The idea was great, but the \nmethod just a bit clumsy, because he used vowels as well \nas consonants in the system. Since 1730, however, many \nchanges have been made, although the idea is basically \nthe same. \nIn order for you to learn the method, you must first \nlearn a simple phonetic alphabet. No need for dismay—it \nconsists of only ten sounds, and with my help, it shouldn't \ntake you more than ten minutes to learn them. This will \nbe the most worthwhile ten minutes you've ever spent, \nsince this phonetic alphabet will eventually help you to \nremember numbers, or numbers in conjunction with any- \n50 Peg System of Memory  \nthing else, in such a way that you never would have thought \npossible. \nIwill give you now, a different consonant sound for each \nof the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 0. These you must \ncommit to memory. I'll make this simple for you by giving \nyou a \"memory aid\" for remembering each one. Read them \ncarefully and with your full attention. \nThe sound for #1 will always be—T or D. The letter \nThas one downstroke. \nThe sound for # 2 will always be—N. Typewritten n has \ntwo downstrokes. \nThe sound for #3 will always be—M. Typewritten m \nhas three downstrokes. \nThe sound for #4 will always be—R. Final sound of \nthe word, \"four\" is R. \nThe sound for #5 will always be—L. Roman numeral \nfor 50 is L. \nThe sound for #6 will always be—], ch, sh, soft g, etc. \nThe letter ] turned around is almost like the number 6. \n(j6) \nThe sound for #7 will always be—K, hard c, hard g. The \nnumber 7 can be used to form a K. One seven rightside up, \nand the other upside down. ( \"K )  \nThe sound for #8 will always be—F or V. Written f \nand figure 8 both have two loops, one above the other. \n(f8). \nThe sound for #9 will always be—P or B. The number \n9. turned around is P. \nThe sound for 0 (zero) will always be—S or Z. First \nsound of the word, \"zero.\" \nIf you will attempt to picture the little memory aid that \nIhave given with each one, you should remember them \neasily. Please keep in mind that the letters are not impor- \nPeg System of Memory  51 \ntant; we are interested in the sound only. That's why I call \nthis a phonetic alphabet. With some of the digits I've \ngiven more than one letter, but the phonetic sounds of these \nletters are the same, in each case. Your lips, tongue and \nteeth are used in the same identical way to sound P and B, \nor F and V, or J, sh, ch, etc. The sound of the letter G in \nthe exclamation, \"gee\" would, according to the phonetic \nalphabet, represent #6, whereas the same letter in the \nword, \"go\" would represent #7. The letter C in the word \n\"coat\" represents #7, the same letter in the word \"cent\" \nwould represent zero, since it is pronounced with the \nssound. The letters Kn in the word, \"knee\" or \"knife\" \nwould stand for #2, because the K is silent. Remember \nthen, it is the sound that's important, not the letter. \nNow, look this over once:— \n1. T, D 6. J, sh, ch, g \n2. N 7. K, c, g \n3. M 8. F, v \n4. R 9. P, b \n5. L 0. Z, s \nTurn away from this page and see if you remember the \nsounds from one to zero. Test yourself on remembering \nthem out of order, too. You should know them all by now. \nIcould give you one more aid for memorizing these sounds, \nby telling you to remember this nonsense phrase: TeN \nMoRe LoGiC FiBS. This will help you to memorize the \nsounds in order from one to zero. It is necessary, however, \nto know them out of sequence—so you shouldn't have to \nrely on the nonsense phrase too long—the original memory \naids that I gave you, should suffice. \nThis simple phonetic alphabet is of utmost importance, \nand the sounds should be practiced until they are second \nnature to you. Once they are, the rest of the Peg system \nwill be a cinch for you. Here is a method of practice to \n52 Peg System of Memory \nhelp you learn the sounds thoroughly:— Anytime you see \nanumber, break it down into sounds in your mind. For \nexample, you might see the number 3746 on a license \nplate; you should be able to read it as m, k, r, j. You might \nsee an address 85-29, and be able to read it as fl-np. You \ncan look at any word and practice breaking it down into \nnumbers. The word \"motor\" would be 314. The word \n\"paper\" is 994, and \"cigarette\" would break down to 0741. \n(The double tt is the same sound as a single t, therefore it \nrepresents #1, not #11.) \nNone of the vowels, a e i o or u have any meaning at all \nin the phonetic alphabet; neither do the letters w, h or y.  \n(Remember the word, \"why\"). \nBefore going any further, complete the following exer- \ncises. The first column of words should be changed to num- \nbers, and the second column of numbers must be broken \ninto sounds. \nclimb_____  6124 _____  \nbutler ______ 8903 _____  \nchandelier ______ 2394 _____  \nsounds______ 0567 _____  \nbracelet ______ 1109 _____  \nhypnotize ______ 8374 _____  \nYou are ready now to learn some of those \"pegs\" I men- \ntioned. I would suggest however, that you know the sounds \nthoroughly before you go on to the pegs themselves. \nAll right, since we now know a certain phonetic sound \nfor all the digits from one to zero, you can see that we can \nmake up a word for any number, no matter how many \ndigits it contains. For example, if we wanted to make up \naword for #21, we could use any of the following:—net, \nnut, knot, gnat, nod, neat, note, knit, etc., because they all \nbegin with the n sound (#2) and end with the t or d \nsound (#1). For #14 we could use tear, tire, tore, door, \nPeg System of Memory  53 \ntier, deer, dire, dray, tree, etc., because they all begin with \nthe t or d sound for #1, and end with the r sound for #4. \nRemember that we are interested in the consonant sounds \nonly. \nDo you get the idea of how I formed those words? If \nyou do, then I can go ahead and give you the first few \n\"pegs.\" Each one of the peg words that I will give you has \nbeen specially chosen because it is comparatively easy to \npicture in your mind, and that is important. \nSince the number 1 contains only one digit, and that one \ndigit is represented by the t or d sound, we must use a \nword that contains only that one consonant sound. So, we \nwill use the word, \"TIE.\" From here on in, the word, \"tie\" \nwill always represent the number 1 to you. \nAs I said, it is important to be able to picture these \nobjects, so I will give explanations of all those where I \nthink an explanation is necessary. \nThe word, \"NOAH\" will always represent #2. Picture \nan old, white haired man on an ark. \nThe word, \"MA\" will always mean #3. Here I suggest \nthat you always picture your own mother. \nThe word, \"RYE\" will always represent the number 4. \nYou can picture either a bottle of Rye whiskey or a loaf of \nrye bread. Once you decide on a particular mind picture for \nthis, or for any of the pegs, use that particular picture \nalways. You can see how I arrive at these words. They all \nhave only one consonant sound, and that one sound is the \none representing the digit of the number. \nThe word, \"LAW\" will always represent #5. The word \n\"law\" itself, cannot be pictured; I suggest that you picture \nany policeman, in uniform, because they represent the law. \nNumber 6 is the word \"SHOE.\" Number 7 is the word \n\"COW.\" Number 8 is the word, \"IVY.\" For this one, you \ncan picture either Poison Ivy, or ivy growing all over the \n54 Peg System of Memory  \nsides of a house. Number 9 is the word, \"BEE.\" Number \n10 has two digits, the digit 1 and a zero. The peg word \nfor #10 therefore must be made up of a t or d sound and \nan s or z sound, in that order. We'll use the word, \"TOES\" \n—picture your own toes. \nOrdinarily it would be a little difficult to remember ten \ncompletely unassociated words as I have just given you. \nSince the peg word for any number must contain certain \nsounds only, you'll find that it is easy. As a matter of fact, \nif you have read the ten words once, with a little concentra- \ntion, you probably already know them. Try it! \nWhen you say the number to yourself, think of its sound \nfirst, then try to remember the peg word. Test yourself in \nand out of order. You should know that # 3 is \"ma,\" with- \nout repeating, \"tie,\" \"Noah,\" ma! \nTo show you how fantastic your memory can be with my \nlittle memory aids, you can do this until the words become \nsecond nature to you; If you come to a number, and you \nthink you can't remember its peg—think of the sound for \nthat number, and say any words that come to your mind, \nstarting with, and containing that particular consonant \nsound only. When you say the right one, it will sort of \n\"ring a bell\" in your mind, and you'll know that that's the \nright one. For instance, if you couldn't think of the peg \nword for #1, you might say to yourself, \"toy, tow, tea, tie\"; \nas soon as you say \"tie,\" you'll know that that is the correct \nword. \nYou can see, now, what I've done. I have built you up \nslowly with each item. First I gave you an aid to remember \nthe phonetic sounds, now those sounds are your aid to \nremember the very important peg words; and the peg \nwords will help you to remember anything where numbers \nare involved, so make sure you know them well. \nPeg System of Memory 55 \n1. tie 6. shoe \n2. Noah 7. cow \n3. ma 8. ivy \n4. rye 9. bee \n5. law 10. toes \nNow, if you. feel that you know the first ten peg words \nthoroughly, I'll show you how to use them for remembering \nobjects in and out of order. I'll give you ten objects, out \nof sequence, and prove to you that you can remember them \nafter reading them only once! \n9—purse 5 — typewriter \n6—cigarette 2 — TV set \n4—ashtray 8 — wrist watch \n7—salt-shaker 1 — fountain pen \n3—lamp                             10 — telephone \nThe first one listed is #9—purse. All you have to do is \nto make a ridiculous and/or illogical association of the peg \nword for #9, which is \"bee,\" and purse. If you have realized \nthe importance of actually \"seeing\" these ridiculous asso- \nciations in your mind, you'll have no trouble. For this first \none, you might see yourself opening a purse and a swarm \nof bees fly out of it, stinging you. Just \"see\" the picture for \namoment, then go to the next one. \n#6(shoe)—cigarette. You can see yourself smoking a \nshoe instead of a cigarette, see millions of cigarettes falling \nout of a shoe, or you can see yourself wearing gigantic \ncigarettes instead of shoes. \n#4(rye)—ashtray. You might see yourself dropping \nashes into a scooped out loaf of rye bread instead of an \nashtray, or, you're buttering an ashtray instead of a slice \nof rye bread. \nIam giving you one or more ways that each object can \nbe associated ridiculously with its peg word. You are to use \n56 Peg System of Memory  \nonly one of these pictures for each one. Use one that I give, or \none that you think of yourself. The first illogical picture that \ncomes to mind is usually the best one to use, because that is the \none that will come to mind later on. I'll help you with all ten of \nthem, since it is the first time you are attempting this method; but \nafter this you should be able to do it without my help. \n#7(cow)-salt-shaker. Picture yourself milking a cow, but the \ncow has salt-shakers instead of udders. Or, see saltshakers \ncoming out instead of milk. \n#3(ma) -lamp. You can picture your mother wearing a \ngigantic lamp for a hat. See the lamp going on and off. (Action-\nRule #2.) \n#5 (law) -typewriter. You might \"see\" a policeman putting \nhandcuffs on a typewriter, or you can see a typewriter walking \nthe beat, swinging a club, like a cop. \n#a (Noah) -Television set. You might picture Noah sailing on \natelevision set instead of an ark. \n#8(ivy)-wrist watch. You can see millions of wrist watches \ngrowing all over the side of your house, instead of \nPeg System of Memory  57 \nivy; or, you can see yourself wearing ivy on your wrist instead of \nawatch. \n#1(tie)-fountain pen. Picture yourself wearing a gigantic \nfountain pen instead of a tie, or you might see yourself writing \nwith your tie, instead of a fountain pen. \n#10 (toes) -telephone. See yourself dialing with your toes, or, \nyou pick up the telephone, but it turns out that you're holding \nyour toes. (Probably talking to a heel.) \nNow-take a piece of paper, number it from one to ten, and try \nto fill in the objects in order, without looking at the book. When \nyou come to #1, just picture your peg word, tie, and the \nridiculous picture of you wearing a fountain pen instead of a tie \nwill come back to you immediately. So you know that # 1 is \nfountain pen. When you picture Noah, you will see him on a \ntelevision set instead of an ark; so you know that # 2 is television \nset. \nYou will remember them all quite easily. The wonderful part \nabout it, is that you also know them out of sequence. You can \nsee, of course, that it makes no difference. You can also call \nthem off backwards-just think of the peg word for # 10 (toes) \nand work up to \"tie.\" \nYou should now be thoroughly amazed at your own ability. \nBut wait! Why not memorize twenty-five objects instead of only \nten? Well, at the end of this chapter you will find the peg words for numbers 11 through to 25. Please learn those just as you \nlearned the first ten. When you know them perfectly, try this on \nyour friends. Have them number a sheet of paper from one to \ntwenty or twenty-five, or as many as you wish to showoff with. \nThen have him call out any of those numbers, haphazardly, and \nthen name any tangible object. Ask him to write that object \nalongside the number called. Have him do that until every \nnumber has an object next to it. Now call them right back to him \nfrom # 1 right down to the last one. Then have \n58 Peg System of Memory \nhim call any number, and you immediately give him the \nobject, or have him call any object and you tell him what \nnumber it is!! \nDon't let that last part throw you, there is nothing to \nit. If I was to ask you now what number salt-shaker was, \nyou would \"see\" the ridiculous picture of a cow with salt- \nshakers instead of udders. Since \"cow\" is the peg for #7, \nthen you know that salt-shaker was #7. \nWatch the look of astonishment on your pal's face when \nyou're through! \n- Please do not go on to the next chapter until you are \nsure that you know all the peg words from 1 to 25. \n11. tot 15. towel 19. tub 23. name \n12. tin 16. dish 20. nose 24. Nero \n13. tomb 17. tack 21. net 25. nail \n14. tire 18. dove 22. nun \nFor \"tot,\" it is best to picture a child that you know. \nFor #12, you can see the object called, made out of \"tin.\" \nFor \"tomb,\" picture a gravestone. For #20, you can see \nthe object called, on your face in place of your \"nose.\" For \n\"net,\" you can use either a fishing net, a hair net, or a \ntennis net. \nFor #23, you can see the object you wish to remember \nforming your \"name.\" For instance, if the object were cigar- \nette, you would picture your own name printed out very \nlarge with cigarettes. If you don't care for that idea, you \nmight picture one of your business cards for \"name,\" or any \nother possession that has your name on it. Whatever you \ndecide on, you must use it all the time. For \"Nero,\" I always \npicture a man playing a fiddle. \nRemember, please, that once you decide on a particular \npicture for any of the peg words, you are to use that picture \nall the time. \nIf you know the pegs from 1 to 25 thoroughly, (and I \nPeg System of Memory                                                                 59 \nsuggest that you go no further until you do), and if you feel \nconfident, (or even if you don't) why not take test #2 in \nChapter #3 once again. Try it, and then compare your \npresent score with the original one! \nUses of the Peg and Link Systems  \nNew patient: \"Doctor, I don't know what to do. You've got to \nhelp me; I just can't remember a thing. I've no memory at all. I \nhear something one minute, and the next minute, I forget it! \nTell me, what should I do?\" \ndoctor: \"Pay in advance!\" \nIcan't blame the doctor for wanting his fee in advance \nin the above anecdote; but I guess that most of us who \nforget to pay bills, do so because we don't want to remem- \nber them. According to Austin O'Malley, \"A habit of debt \nis very injurious to the memory.\" Unfortunately, we are \nusually soon reminded of debts. \nIf you've grasped the idea behind the Link and the Peg \nsystems of memory, you have learned two of the three things \nthat your trained memory will be based upon. The third is \nthe system of substitute words or substitute thoughts, which \nIwill discuss in later chapters. \nYou can start applying what you've learned immediately, \nif you want to. Not particularly for remembering debts, \nwhich I'm sure you'd rather forget, but perhaps for memo- \nrizing the errands that you have to do for each day. If you \nusually write out your shopping list, why not try to memo- \nrize it with the help of the Link system. Simply link the \nfirst item to the second item, the second to the third, and \n60 \nUses of the Peg and Link Systems                                        61 \nso on, down the list. You can memorize an entirely different \nlist the next time you go shopping without fear of con- \nfusion. The beautiful thing about the Link method is that \nyou can forget a list whenever you wish. Actually, when \nyou memorize the second shopping list, the first one fades \naway. You can, of course, retain as many lists or links as \nyou desire. \nThe mind is a most fantastic machine; it can be compared \nto a filing cabinet. If you have memorized a list of items \nwith the Link system, which you want to retain—you can. \nIf you want to forget the list—you can. It is merely a ques- \ntion of desire. The list that you want to remember is one \nwhich you probably intend to use, or you would have no \nreason to retain it. The use of the list itself will tend to \netch it into your memory. If it happens to be a list that \nyou do not intend to utilize right away, but which you feel \nyou want to retain for future use—you can do that, too. \nYou would have to go over the list in your mind the day \nafter you memorized it. Then go over it again a few days \nlater. After doing this a few times, you have filed the list \naway, and it will be ready when you need it. \nWe all realize, of course, that it is sometimes necessary \nto forget! Benjamin Disraeli, when asked about the favor \nshown him by royalty, said, \"—I observe a simple rule of \nconduct; I never deny; I never contradict; I sometimes \nforget.\" This, however, is a question of diplomacy, not \nmemory; and I know that you're reading this book not to \nbe taught how to forget, but how to remember. I will show \nyou soon, how to use the Link system to remember speeches, \narticles, anecdotes, etc. \nThe main difference between the Link and the Peg \nmethods is that the Link is used to remember anything in \nsequence, while the Peg is for memorizing things in and out \nof order. You may feel that you have no need for the Peg \n62  Uses of the Peg and Link Systems \nsystem since you don't have to remember anything out of \norder. Believe me when I tell you that you definitely should \nlearn the Peg system thoroughly. It will be extremely useful \nfor remembering telephone numbers, style numbers, long \ndigit numbers, addresses—as a matter of fact, the Peg sys- \ntem will aid you in remembering anything that has to do \nwith numbers in any way. Besides, it will enable you to do \nsome fantastic memory stunts for your friends. \nAlthough I intend to go deeper into memorizing sched- \nules or appointments for the week, day or month, in later \nchapters—I can show you how to apply what you have \nalready learned to this problem, right now. You can use \neither the Peg or Link methods, or one, in conjunction with \nthe other. \nLet's assume that you have the following errands to do \non one particular day: You have to have your car washed \n(now we know that it must rain today); make a deposit \nat the bank; mail a letter; see your dentist; pick up the \numbrella that you forgot at a friend's house (you hadn't \nread the chapter on absent-mindedness, as yet); buy some \nperfume for your wife;, call or see the television repairman; \nstop at the hardware store for bulbs, a hammer, a picture \nframe, an extension cord and an ironing board cover; go to \nthe bookstore to buy a copy of this book for a forgetful \nfriend; have your watch repaired; and finally, bring home \none dozen eggs. (My, but you've got a busy day!) \nNow, as I've said, you can use the Link or Peg systems \nto enable you to remember to do each of the above errands. \nUsing the Link method: Simply make a ridiculous picture \nbetween car and bank—you might see yourself driving into \nthe bank in your recently washed car; you're depositing \nletters instead of money; now picture your dentist pulling \nletters out of your mouth instead of teeth—or, he's using \naletter instead of a drill. To remember the errand concern- \nUses of the Peg and Link Systems  63 \ning the umbrella—picture your dentist working over you \nwhile he's holding an umbrella over his head; make a \nridiculous picture between umbrella and perfume, now, per- \nfume to television; television to hardware; hardware to \nbook; book to watch; and finally, watch to eggs. \nI've given you examples with the first few errands only, \nbecause I want you to use your own imagination for form- \ning ridiculous mental links. You simply do the same as if \nyou were linking a list of objects. Actually it is the same \nthing—when you come to the watch repairing and the pur- \nchase of the dozen eggs, it isn't necessary to get the repair- \ning or amount of eggs into the picture. Just use watch and \negg for your ridiculous picture: i.e. You're breaking an egg, \nand a wrist watch falls out; or, you're wearing an egg \ninstead of a wrist watch. The one item will bring the entire \nerrand to mind, of course. These are just memory aids or \nreminders; you already have remembered that you must \nrepair the watch or that it is a dozen eggs that you need. \nThinking of, or being reminded of watch and egg is all \nthat is necessary to start you off on your errand. \nWhen you get to the hardware store, you have to buy \nfive items. Make a separate link of these five:—you can \nstart by \"seeing\" a large bulb as the proprietor of the store; \nyou break him with a hammer; you frame a hammer and \nhang it on your wall, and so on, to ironing board cover. \nAfter you have linked all your errands for the day, all \nyou have to do, is complete one, and that will remind you \nof the next, and so on. However, you needn't do all these \nerrands in sequence just because you used the Link method \nto remember them. That might make it a little incon- \nvenient, unless you've arranged your errands accordingly. \nNo, you can do them in any order you like. Each time you \ncomplete an errand, go over the link in your mind, in order \nto remind yourself if there is one that is convenient to take \n64 Uses of the Peg and Link Systems \ncare of at that moment, considering the time and place. \nWhen you think you have attended to all your duties for \nthe day, go over the Link, and if there is one you've missed, \nyou'll know it immediately. \nYou can utilize the Peg system, of course, for the same \nthing. Just associate washing the car with your peg word \nfor #1 (tie). You might picture yourself wearing a car \ninstead of a tie. Now, associate \nbank to Noah (#2) \nletter to ma (#3) \ndentist to rye (#4) \numbrella to law (#5) \nperfume to shoe (#6) \ntelevision to cow (#7) \nhardware to ivy (#8) \nbook to bee (#9) \nwatch to toes (#10) \neggs to tot (#11) \nUse the link to remember the different items you want \nat the hardware store. You could even use the Peg for this \nby making another set of associations. i.e. bulb to tie; ham- \nmer to Noah, etc. They wouldn't conflict at all, but it is \neasier to use the Link. \nNow, again, when you're ready to start the day, think \nof your peg for #1 (tie). This will remind you that you \nhave to get the car washed. When that's done, think of \nyour peg for #2 (Noah) and that will remind you to go \nto the bank, etc. You don't have to do these in order, \neither; simply keep going over the pegs, and if you've for- \ngotten something, it'll stand out like an eagle in a canary \ncage. \nThere you have it! No more excuses to the wife that you \nforgot to wash the car, or that you forgot to buy the eggs. \nAs I mentioned before, we'll go further into methods for \nUses of the Peg and Link Systems  65 \nremembering schedules and appointments in another chap- \nter; wherein you will learn to remember appointments for \ndefinite times and days. For the time being what you've \nlearned in this chapter will suffice for simple errands. \nBefore going to bed each night, list your errands and \nappointments for the following day. Memorize them as \nexplained, then go over them in the morning just to make \nsure. That's all there is to it. \nBefore completing this chapter, please learn the pegs for \n#26 through to #50. These, of course, follow the rules of \nthe phonetic alphabet, as do all the pegs. \n26. notch 32. moon 38. movie 44. rower \n27. neck 33. mummy 39. mop 45. roll \n28. knife 34. mower 40. rose 46. roach \n29. knob 35. mule 41. rod 47. rock \n30. mice 36. match 42. rain 48. roof  \n31. mat 37. mug 43. ram 49. rope \n50. lace \nIf the item to be associated with #26 were cigarette, you \ncould see a gigantic cigarette with a \"notch\" in it. For \n\"mower,\" picture a lawn-mower. For \"mug,\" picture a beer \nmug. You can use either a fishing rod or a curtain rod for \n#41. In associating the word for #42, \"rain,\" I usually \npicture it raining the particular item that I want to recall. \nFor \"roll,\" you might use a breakfast roll. \nBe sure that you know all the words from one through \nfifty, thoroughly, before reading any further. You should \nknow the higher numbered words as well as the lower ones. \nAgood way to practice this would be to remember a list \nof twenty-five objects, in and out of sequence, using the \npeg words from 26 to 50 to do it. Just number the paper \nfrom 26 to 50 instead of 1 to 25. After a day or so, if you \nfeel ambitious, you can try a list of fifty items. If you make \nsure that you use strong, ridiculous associations, you \nshouldn't have any trouble remembering all of them. \nhave you looked at the phrase in the box on top of this \npage? If you have, read it again to make sure that you \nknow what it says. Now turn your head away from the \nbook and repeat the phrase. Check it again to see if you \nhave it right! Some of you will probably think it's a bit \nsilly for me to ask you to keep making sure of a simple \nphrase like that, but it's important for you to be absolutely \naware of what it says. \nNow—if you've looked at it closely at least three times; \nwhat does it say!? Does it say, \"Paris in the spring\"? I \n66 How to Train Your Observation\nHow to Train Your Observation  67 \nguess that most of you are nodding, \"Yes, of course, that's \nwhat it says.\" Well, at the risk of being repetitious, check \nit again, will you? \nHave you looked at it again? If you still think it reads, \n\"Paris in the spring,\" your observation is not as keen as it \nshould be. If you will check it once more, and this time \npoint to each word as you read the phrase, you will be \namazed to discover that it reads, \"Paris in the the spring\"! \nThere is one \"the\" too many in the phrase! \nNow you see why I asked you to look at it repeatedly. I \nwanted to prove that you could look at it any number of \ntimes and still not notice the extra \"the.\" If you did notice \nit right away, don't feel too elated. I honestly didn't know \nwhether this little stunt would be as effective when it \nappeared on top of a page of print, as when used by itself. \nYou see, I've tested hundreds of people with this, and only \none or two spotted it quickly. Prove it to yourself by print- \ning it just exactly as I have it, on a 3x5 index card, or on \napiece of paper of similar size. The little x under the \nword, \"spring\" is just misdirection. It tends to draw the \nreaders' eyes down to it, and their minds jump ahead on \nthe phrase itself, because it is such a familiar one. Make one \nand try it with your friends. I've had people look at it as \nmany as ten or fifteen times, and they were willing to bet \nanything that they knew just what it said. You can ask \nthem to read out loud directly from the card, and they still \nsay, \"Paris in the spring\"! \nIam discussing this only to show that the sense of \nobservation could stand a little sharpening, for most of us. \nAs I said earlier in the book, although my systems actually \nforce you to observe if you apply them—your sense of \nobservation can be strengthened with a little practice. If \nyou're interested in helping your memory, don't sell observa- \ntion short. You just can't remember anything that you do \n68 How to Train Your Observation  \nnot observe to begin with. Educator Eustace H. Miles said \nabout the same thing, \"What one has never properly \nrealized, one cannot properly be said to remember either.\" \nIf you haven't observed, then you haven't realized, and \nwhat you haven't realized you can't forget, since you never \nreally remembered it in the first place. \nIf you want to take the time, it is a simple matter to \nstrengthen your sense of observation. You can start right \nnow! You're probably reading this at home, sitting in a \nroom that should be thoroughly familiar to you. Take a \npiece of paper, and without looking around you, list every- \nthing in the room. Don't leave out anything you can think \nof, and try to describe the entire room in detail. List every \nashtray, every piece of furniture, pictures, doodads, etc. \nNow, look around the room and check your list. Notice all \nthe things you did not put down on your list, or never \nreally observed, although you have seen them countless \ntimes. Observe them now! Step out of the room and test \nyourself once more. Your list should be longer this time. \nYou might try the same thing with other rooms in your \nhome. If you keep at this, your observation will be keener \nno matter where you happen to be. \nYou've all heard, I'm sure, of the little experiment that \nacollege professor tried with his students. He had a violent \nmurder scene enacted in front of them, without letting them \nknow that it was just an act. All of the students were told \nthat they must act as witnesses, and were told to describe, \nin detail, what they saw. Of course, all the descriptions \nvaried, even down to what the murderer looked like. All \nthe students in the class had seen the same thing, but their \nobservation and their memories were faulty. \nThis was proven again quite recently by popular enter- \ntainer, Steve Allen, on his TV show, \"Tonight.\" Some \nHow to Train Your Observation  69 \nmembers of his cast suddenly burst in front of the cameras, \nenacting a wild, violent scene. Some shots were fired \n(blanks, of course), clothes were torn, and so on. The \nwhole thing lasted perhaps a minute. Then Mr. Allen had \nthree members of the audience come up to attempt to \nanswer some pertinent questions about the scene. He asked \nhow many shots were fired, who was shooting at whom, \ncolor of clothing, etc. All the answers varied and nobody \nseemed quite sure of anything. As a matter of fact, when \nSteve asked Skitch Henderson (who had fired the shots) \nhow many shots he had fired—Skitch wasn't too sure \nhimself. \nOf course, you can't go around looking for violent scenes \nto observe—but, you can practice in this way:—Think of \nsomeone whom you know very well. Try to picture his or \nher face; now see if you can describe the face on paper. \nList everything you can possibly remember. Go into detail \n—list color of hair and eyes, complexion, any or all out- \nstanding features, whether or not they wear glasses, what \ntype of glasses, type of nose, ears, eyes, mouth, forehead, \napproximate height and weight, hairline, on which side is \nthe hair parted, is it parted at all, etc., etc. The next time \nyou see this person, check yourself. Note the things you \ndidn't observe and those you observed incorrectly. Then \ntry it again! You will improve rapidly. \nAgood way to practice this is in a subway or bus, or any \npublic conveyance. Look at one person for a moment, close \nyour eyes and try to mentally describe every detail of this \nperson's face. Pretend that you are a witness at a criminal \ninvestigation, and your description is of utmost importance. \nThen look at the person again (don't stare, or you will be \nin a criminal investigation) and check yourself. You'll find \nyour observation getting finer each time you try it. \n70 How to Train Your Observation  \nOne last suggestion as to a form of practice. Look at any \nshop window display. Try to observe everything in it (with- \nout using the Peg or Link systems). Then list all the items \nwithout looking at the display. You can wait until you're \nhome to do this; then go back to check, when you can. Note \nthe items you left out and try it again. When you think \nyou've become proficient at it, try remembering the prices \nof the items also. \nEach time you do any of these exercises, your sense of \nobservation will become noticeably sharper. Although all \nthis is not absolutely necessary for the acquiring of a trained \nmemory, it is a simple matter to strengthen your observa- \ntion. If you take the little time to practice, you will soon \nbegin to observe better, automatically. \nBefore reading any further, I would suggest that you \nmemorize the Peg Words from 51 to 75. I might also sug- \ngest that for the time being, you use the words that I give \nyou. You could, of course, make up your own words, as long \nas they stay in the phonetic alphabet system. These would \nprobably serve you just as well, but you might pick some \nwords that would conflict with some of the words that \nyou will eventually learn for other purposes. So, wait until \nyou've finished the book, and then change words to your \nheart's content. \n51. lot 57. log 63. chum 69. ship \n52. lion 58. lava 64. cherry 70. case \n53. loom 59. lip 65. jail 71. cot \n54. lure 60. cheese 66. choo choo 72. coin \n55. lily 61. sheet 67. chalk 73. comb \n56 leech 62. chain 65. chef 74. car \n75. coal \nFor \"lot,\" picture an empty lot. For \"loom,\" you might \nfind it easier to picture a spinning wheel. \"Lure\" is bait \nfor fishing; you might picture a worm. For \"chum,\" you \nHow to Train Your Observation  71 \ncan picture a particularly close friend; if you do, use the \nsame friend each time. \"Choo choo\" is a train, of course. \nFor \"chef,\" picture a chef's hat. For \"case,\" see a large \nwooden packing crate, or a suitcase. \nIt Pays to Remember Speeches, Articles, \nScripts and Anecdotes  \nThe confused and nervous speaker was introduced after dinner. \nHe approached the microphone and murmured haltingly: \n\"My f-f-friends, wh-when I arrived here this evening only God \nand I knew what I was going to say to you. And now, only God \nknows!\" \nIguess that one of the most embarrassing things that can \nhappen to a person is to forget a speech while in front of \nhis audience. Next to forgetting the speech, is the embar- \nrassment of faltering along as if you're not sure of what you \nhave to say. Actually, it seems to me that anyone who is \nasked to give a talk on any particular subject, must know \nthat subject pretty well; otherwise why would he be asked \nto talk about it. No; speakers who falter or hesitate during \ntheir speeches, do so, I think, because they have forgotten \nthe next word—or because they are fearful that they will \nforget the next word. \nThere, in my opinion, lies the problem. If a speech is \nmemorized word for word, and then a word, here and there, \nis forgotten; it surely will not be delivered as it should be. \nWhy should you have to grope for one particular word? \nIf you can't think of it; why, use any other word that serves \n72 \nSpeeches, Articles, Scripts and Anecdotes  73 \nthe same purpose. Isn't that much better than hemming \nand hawing until you remember the exact phrasing just the \nway you memorized it? \nThe people who realized this, felt that the next best thing \nwould be to simply read the speech. This solves the prob- \nlem of forgetting words, until you lose your place on the \npaper, and forget what you're talking about altogether. \nBesides, it seems to me that there is a subtle annoyance \nevident in an audience that is listening to someone reading \naspeech word for word. I know I feel that way: he might \njust as well have given me a printed copy of the speech \nto read at my own leisure. \nSo, the next step seems to be not to prepare at all. Well, \nnot quite. Even if you are well versed in your subject, you \nmay forget some of the facts you want to speak about. As \nin the case of the itinerant preacher who always complained \nthat he made his best speeches on the way home. All that \nhe had forgotten to tell his listeners came to mind then, \nand his horse usually got the best part of the speech. \nIbelieve that the best way to prepare a speech is to lay \nit out thought for thought. Many of our better speakers do \njust that. They simply make a list of each idea or thought \nthat they want to talk about, and use this list in lieu of \nnotes. In this way, you can't forget words, since yon haven't \nmemorized any. You can hardly lose your place; one glance \nat your list will show you the next thought to put into \nwords. \nBut, for those of you who would rather not rely on pieces \nof paper—the Link method can help you easily. If you wish \nto memorize your speech thought for thought, from the \nbeginning to the end, you would be forming a sequence. \nThat's why you would use the Link method of memory to \nmemorize it. \nIwould suggest that you go about it something like \n74 Speeches, Articles, Scripts and Anecdotes  \nthis:—First, write out or read the entire speech. When \nyou're satisfied with it, read it over once or twice more to \nget the \"gist\" of it. Now, get yourself a piece of paper and \nstart to list your KEY WORDS. \nRead the first thought of the speech. This might be con- \ntained in one, two or more sentences; it doesn't matter. \nNow select one word or phrase from these sentences which \nyou think will bring the entire thought to mind! That is \nnot at all difficult. In every sentence or paragraph there \nmust be one word or phrase which will remind you of the \nentire thought. That one word or phrase is your Key Word. \nAfter you have found the Key Word for the first thought, \nfind one for the next thought, and so on. When you're \nthrough with the whole speech, you'll have a list of Keys \nto remind you of each thing you want to say. Actually, if \nyou were to keep this list in front of you as you made the \nspeech, it would serve the purpose. But, if you've mastered \nthe Link system, you know that it is just as easy to make a \nlink of these Key Words, and then throw away the paper. \nYou might, for example, be giving a talk on your local \nschool problems at a Parent-Teacher Association meeting. \nYour list of Key Words might look something like this:— \ncrowds, teachers, fire, furniture, subjects, playground, etc. \nIn other words, you wish to start your speech with a refer- \nence to the crowded conditions in the class rooms. Then \nyou want to talk about the teachers; perhaps about methods \nand salaries, etc. Now, you express your thoughts on fire \ndrills and fire precautions, which leads you into your dis- \ncussion on the state of the school's furniture; the desks, \nchairs, blackboards, equipment, and so on. Now, you would \ntalk about your ideas on the subjects taught, and finally, the \nrecreation (playground) facilities of the school. \nYou can see that if you make a link: crowd associated to \nteacher; teacher to fire; fire to furniture, etc., each thought \nSpeeches, Articles, Scripts and Anecdotes  75 \nwould lead you to the next one, right through to the end \nof your speech! \nAt first, you may have to list, perhaps, two or three Key \nWords for some thoughts. List as many of them as you \nneed, to remember the entire speech. As you use this idea, \nthe amount of Keys necessary will be less and less. And, \nmost important, the confidence you gain by knowing, that \nyou remember your talk, will show when you deliver it. \nJust keep in mind that you must take care of the thoughts; \nthe words will take care of themselves! \nIf, for some reason or other, you wish to memorize a \nspeech word for word, use the same method. You'll just \nhave to go over it more often. Remember that all these \nsystems arc aids to your true memory. \"If you remember \nthe main, the incidentals will fall into place.\" You actually \nnever forget anything you've remembered, you just have to \nbe reminded of it; the system in this book will do that for \nyou. So, if you remember the main thoughts of your speech, \nthe incidentals, the ifs, ands and buts, will fall into place. \nThe same ideas are used to memorize any article you \nread, if you desire. First read the article, of course, to get \nthe \"gist\" of it. Then pick out the Key Words for each \nthought; then make a link to remember them, and you've \ngot it. With a bit of practice, you'll actually be able to do \nthis as you read. \nMany times while reading for enjoyment, I'll come across \nsome piece of information that I'd like to remember. I \nsimply make a conscious association of it, while I'm read- \ning. This idea can, if used enough, speed up your reading \nconsiderably. I think that most people are slow readers \nbecause by the time they've reached the third paragraph, \nthey've forgotten what was in the first; so they have to \njump back. \nThere is no need to associate everything; just the points \n76 Speeches, Articles, Scripts and Anecdotes \nthat you feel are necessary to remember. Perhaps, if you use \nmy systems, you will fall into the first class of readers in \nAmerican educator, William Lyon Phelps' two classes. He \nonce said, \"I divide all readers into two classes; those who \nread to remember and those who read to forget.\" \nThe same system of linking Key Words can be used \nfor remembering lyrics and scripts. Of course, in this case \nit is usually necessary to memorize them word for word. \nYou will have to go over them more often, but the Key \nWord idea will make the job that much easier for you. If \nyou have trouble memorizing your cues in a play, why not \nassociate the last word of the other actor's line to the first \nword of your line. Even if your cue tells you that you must \nperform an action, instead of speaking a line, you can still \nassociate it. If the last word of the line prior to your action \nhappens to be, say, \"walk\"; and the script calls for you to \nstoop down to pick up a cigarette butt—make a picture in \nyour mind of yourself walking along and continually stoop- \ning to pick up cigarette butts. (In this way you will never \nwalk on another actor's lines.) \nI'll mention one other use of the Key Word idea, before \nleaving it entirely. How many times have you wanted to \ntell your friends some jokes or anecdotes that you recently \nheard, only to find that you've forgotten them completely? \nYou can hear a whole batch of really funny stories one day, \nand have them all, or most of them, slip your mind the \nnext. Well, according to Irvin S. Cobb, \"A good storyteller \nis a person who has a good memory and hopes other people \nhaven't.\" \nYour memory for stories and anecdotes will improve \nimmediately if you use the Key Word system. Just take one \nword from the story, a word from the punch line is usually \nbest, that will bring the entire joke to mind. When you \nget your Key Words, you can either link them to each other \nSpeeches, Articles, Scripts and Anecdotes  77 \nto remember all the stories in sequence, or use the Peg sys- \ntem to remember them by number. \nPerhaps you've heard the gag that has been making the \nrounds recently about the Flying Saucer that landed in \nAmerica. Out stepped a creature from outer space—brushed \nhimself off with one of his six arms, looked around with the \none large eye in the center of his forehead, and kept his \nantennae alert for any sounds. \nAfter exploring a bit, he finally approached a gas station, \nwalked over to the gasoline pump, saluted, and demanded, \n\"Take me to your President\"! \nWell, if you hadn't heard this before, and wanted to \nremember it with perhaps ten or twelve other stories—you \ncould use either, flying saucer, creature from outer space or, \ngasoline pump as your Key Word for this story. Any one of \nthese would surely bring the entire story to mind, if you \nliked it in the first place. \nAlthough I'm sure that many of you will find some prac- \ntical use for it, one of the memory stunts I sometimes use \n78 Speeches, Articles, Scripts and Anecdotes  \nin my shows is the \"magazine test.\" This usually causes a \nbit of comment because it seems to be the most amazing \nof memory feats. Actually it is basic and simple. \nWhat happens is this:—The audience is given some \ncopies of a current magazine. (I usually use Tempo Maga- \nzine, which is published by the Enterprise Magazine Man- \nagement, Inc.) They are then asked to call any page num- \nber, and I immediately tell them the highlights of that \nparticular page. \nThis is merely another use of the Peg system of memory. \nIn some instances the Link method is used in conjunction \nwith the Peg, as will be explained directly. To memorize the \npages of any picture magazine, all you have to do is to asso- \nciate the peg word that represents the page number to the \nhighlight of that page. \nFor example:— If Page #1 has a picture of an airplane \non it, you would make a ridiculous association between \n\"tic\" (1) and airplane. \nPage #2 might be an advertisement for shoe polish. \nAssociate \"Noah\" to shoe polish. \nPage #3 has a picture of a horse on it. Associate \"ma\" \nto horse. \nPage #4 might have a picture of a circus scene; just \nassociate \"rye\" to circus. \nPage #5 is an advertisement for a television set. Asso- \nciate \"law\" to television set. \nPage #6 is a book review. Associate \"shoe\" to book. \nThat's all there is to it. If you go over the magazine and \nyour associations two or three times, you will know the \nhighlights of every page. If a page has more than one pic- \nture on it, use the Link method to remember them. Assume \nthat page #14 is a fashion page, and it has a picture of a \nhat, one of gloves and a third of a dress. \nFirst associate \"tire\" (14) to the first picture, which is \nSpeeches, Articles, Scripts and Anecdotes  79 \nof a hat. Now, link hat to gloves, and then gloves to dress. \nWhen Page #14 is called, the peg word will remind you \nof hat; hat will tell you that the next picture is of gloves, \nand gloves will remind you of dress. \nIf you have seen my performance, you know that I also \ntell the audience on what part of the page the picture is \nlocated; whether it is on the lower or upper left part of the \npage, upper or lower right, or center, etc. Well, you can \ndo this too, and without any extra effort. \nAs I've already mentioned, your normal or true memory \ndoes most of the work for you; these systems are just aids \nthat make it easier. As you use my systems you'll find your \ntrue memory getting stronger. The best example of this is \nin memorizing a magazine. In order to make the associa- \ntions in the first place, you must really see and observe the \npicture on the page. Because of this, when any page number \nis called, the peg word for that number acts as an aid to \nenable you to almost reproduce the entire page in your \nmind's eye. You will know on what part of the page the pic- \nture is located. You can only prove this to yourself by try- \ning it. \nThe only thing you will not be able to do as yet, is to \nremember the names of any people pictured on the pages. \nThis problem will be solved for you after you've read the \nchapters on remembering names and faces, and how to \nutilize substitute words or thoughts. \nBefore reading any further, learn the last of the one \nhundred peg words. \n76. cage 82. phone 88. fife 94. bear \n77. coke 83. foam 89. fob 95. bell \n78. cave 84. fur 90. bus 96. beach \n79. cob 85. file 91. bat 97. book \n80. fez 86. fish 92. bone 98. puff \n81. fit 87. fog 93. bum 99. pipe \n100. thesis or disease \n80 Speeches, Articles, Scripts and Anecdotes \nFor \"cob,\" picture corn on the cob. For \"fit,\" you can \npicture an epileptic fit, or a girdle (tight fit). For \"file,\" \nyou can use cither a filing cabinet or a nail file. \"Fob\" is a \nwatch fob. For \"bat,\" picture a baseball bat. For \"puff,\" \npicture a ladies' powder puff, and for \"pipe\" see a man's \nsmoking pipe. \nAfter learning these, you should be able to count from \none to one hundred quickly, with your peg words only. \nThe beauty of it is that you don't have to take time out \nto practice them. If you're traveling to work, or doing any- \nthing that doesn't require thought—you can go over all the \npegs in your mind. If you go over them just every once in \nawhile, they'll soon be as familiar to you as the numbers \nfrom one to one hundred. \nIt Pays to Remember Playing Cards  \n\"Yes, my grandfather was a gambler, and he died at a very early \nage.\" \n\"Gosh, that's too bad. How did it happen?\" \n\"He died of five Aces!\" \nsince I want yon all to stay healthy, the memory feats in \nthis lesson utilize a regular deck of cards; not with five, but \nwith the usual four Aces. Truthfully, although this chapter \nis devoted entirely to remembering playing cards, I am \nstressing the demonstrations you can do with a deck of \ncards and your trained memory. The systems, however, can \nbe applied to many card games. Please don't think that \nafter you've mastered these you can always win at cards. \nKeep in mind that you can't beat a man at his own game. \nIwill leave the applications of the systems up to you; I \nuse them for demonstration purposes only. \nThe late Damon Runvon used the following in one of \nhis stories: \" 'Son,' the old guy says, 'no matter how far you \ntravel, or how smart you gel, always remember this: Some- \nday, somewhere, a guy is going to come to you and show \nyou a nice brand new deck of cards on which the seal is \nnever broken, and this guy is going to offer to bet you that \nthe Jack of Spades will jump out of this deck and squirt \ncider in your ear.' \n81 \n82 Playing Cards  \n\"'But, son,' the old guy says, 'do not bet him, for as \nsure as you do you are going to get an ear full of cider.' \" \nThe memory stunts you will do with cards after studying \nthese methods will seem almost as amazing to your friends. \nAside from that, they are also wonderful memory exercises. \nIsuggest that you read and learn the contents of this chap- \nter whether or not you indulge in card playing. \nCards, of course, are difficult to picture, just as numbers \nwere before you started reading this book. In order for you \nto be able to remember them, I'll show you how to make \nthem mean something; something that you can picture in \nyour mind. Some years ago I read an article in a popular \nmagazine about a professor who was trying some sort of \nexperiment. He was attempting to teach people how to \nmemorize the order of a shuffled deck of cards. The article \nmentioned the fact that he had accomplished his goal. \nAfter six months of training, his students were able to look \nat a mixed deck for twenty minutes or more, and then call \noff the cards. I don't know the exact system that was used, \nbut I do know that it had something to do with seeing the \ncards actually laid out in order, in the mind. I have nothing \nagainst this; it's just that it shouldn't take you more than \naday or two at the most to learn my system. When you \nhave mastered it, it won't take twenty minutes to memo- \nrize a shuffled deck of cards. It might take about ten min- \nutes at first, and with time and practice, you'll cut it down \nto five minutes! \nThere are actually two things that you must know in \norder to remember cards. First, is a list of at least fifty-two \npeg words for the numbers 1 to 52; these you already know. \nYou also have to know a peg word for every card in a deck \nof cards. These card peg words are not chosen at random. \nAs with the number pegs, they are selected because they \nPlaying Cards  83 \nare easy to picture, and because they follow a definite sys- \ntem. Here it is, in a nutshell:— \nBarring a few exceptions which will be discussed later, \nevery card peg word will begin with the initial letter of the \ncard suit. i.e.—All the words for the Spade suit will begin \nwith the letter, \"S\"; all the words for the Diamond suit will \nbegin with the letter, \"D\"; the Club suit—with \"C,\" and \nthe Heart suit with \"H.\" Each word will end with a con- \nsonant sound; this sound will represent the numerical value \nof the card, according to our phonetic alphabet. \nYou can see then, that the word you use must represent \nonly one particular card. The first letter will give you the \nsuit, the last sound will give you the value. Let me give you \nsome examples:—the peg word for the Two of Clubs must \nbegin with the letter, \"C,\" and must end with the N sound, \nwhich represents 2. Of course, there are many words that \nwould fall into this category; cone, coin, can, cane, etc. I've \nselected the word, \"can.\" \"Can\" will always represent the \nTwo of Clubs! Which card would the word, \"hog\" stand \nfor? Well, it could represent only one card. It begins with \n\"H,\" therefore it's a Heart; it ends with the hard \"g\" sound, \nwhich represents #7—\"hog\" is the peg word for the Seven \nof Hearts. Can you think of a word for the Six of Dia- \nmonds? Well, it has to begin with a \"D\" and end with the \nJor sh sound—we'll use the word, \"dash\" to represent the \nSix of Diamonds. \nHere are all fifty-two card peg words. Look them over \ncarefully, and I assure you that you can know and retain \nthem with no more than perhaps twenty minutes to a half \nhour of study. Look them over once, then read on for the \nexplanation of the exceptions, and how to picture some of \nthe words. Towards the end of this chapter I'll give you a \nmethod to enable you to learn these words thoroughly. \nThe exact system for forming the card pegs has been \nused for the Aces to Tens only. The reason for this should \nbe obvious to you. If we were to follow the same system for \nthe court, or picture cards, each court card peg word would \nhave to contain two consonant sounds aside from the first \nletter. This is so because the Jack represents #11, the \nQueen—#12 and the King—#13. It would be a bit diffi- \ncult to find words that are easy to picture, and which would \nstill fit into the system. So, for the four Jacks I simply use \nthe name of the suit itself for the peg word; each of which \nis a word that is easily pictured. The King of Clubs and \nQueen of Hearts will always be represented by the words, \n\"king\" and \"queen\" respectively. For the remaining court \ncards I have chosen words that begin with the initial suit \nletter, and that rhyme as closely as possible to the sound of \nthe card itself, i.e. King (Spades)—sing: Queen (Dia- \nmonds)—dream. \nDon't let these exceptions throw you, they'll stick in your \nmind because of the fact that they are exceptions. \nIf you have looked at the list of card pegs, you have un- \ndoubtedly recognized some of them as being the same as \nyour number words. This will not create any confusion \nPlaying Cards 85 \nsince the duplications only occur with words over #52 in \nyour pegs. Being that there are only fifty-two cards in a \ndeck, the words will never conflict. \nYou are to do the same with the card words as you did \nwith the number pegs. Select a certain mind picture for \neach word, and use that picture all the time. For the word, \n\"core,\"you might picture the core of an apple. For, \"cuff,\" \npicture a pair of trousers, or just the cuff of the trousers. For \nthe King of Clubs, picture the item to be associated as sit- \nting on a throne, being the \"king.\" The same goes for the \nQueen of Hearts—be sure that in your pictures for \"king\" \nand \"queen\" you have something to distinguish one from \nthe other. (Picturing \"queen\" in a long flowing gown, and \nthe \"king\" in knee breeches would do it.) If you had to \nremember that the King of Clubs was the 19th card; you \ncould picture a \"tub\" (19) sitting on a throne, wearing a \ncrown, and being a \"king.\" Another idea, of course, would \nbe to see a king wearing a tub instead of a crown. Either \npicture is a good one. \nFor the word, \"hoof,\" it's best to picture a horseshoe; \nfor \"hose\" you can see cither a garden hose, or ladies' hose; \nfor \"hinge,\" picture the associated item being hinged. If \nyou wanted to remember that the Two of Spades was the \n29th card, you might see a gigantic door \"knob\" (29) in- \nstead of the \"sun\" (2S) shining in the sky with a tremen- \ndous brilliance. For \"sum,\" picture a sheet of paper cov- \nered with numbers; or, an adding machine. For the word, \n\"sore,\" I usually picture the associated item with a large \nbandage, as if it had a wound or sore. \"Sash\"—picture a \nwindow sash. \"Steam\"—picture a radiator. For \"sing,\" you \ncan picture a sheet of music, or you can see the associated \nitem singing. \"Date\"—picture the fruit, or a calendar. \n\"Dash\"—picture the associated item running the 100 yard \ndash. \"Dive\"—picture the item diving into a body of water. \n86 Playing Cards \n\"Deb\"—is the abbreviation of debutante. For \"dose\" it is \nbest to picture a spoonful of medicine. \nThe few suggestions above, are just that—suggestions. \nYou must decide which picture you will \"see\" for each card \nword, just as you did with the number words. After you've \ndecided, use that picture only. Use any picture that the \nword brings to mind; but be sure that the mental picture \nfor any card word does not conflict with the mental picture \nof any of your number pegs from 1 to 52. \nYou now have all you need to memorize a complete deck \nof cards. Since each card is represented by an object, you \nsimply use the Peg system as if you were memorizing a list \nof fifty-two objects! That's all there is to it. If the first card \nis the Five of Spades, you might see a large tie (1) acting as \nasail on a boat; or, you're wearing a sailboat instead of a tie. \nIf the second card were the Eight of Diamonds, you could \nsee Noah (2) diving into the water. Third card—Two of \nSpades—see your ma (3) in the sky instead of the sun. \nFourth card—Queen of Diamonds—see a bottle of rye (4) \nPlaying Cards  87 \nsleeping and dreaming; or, you are dreaming of a bottle of \nrye. Fifth card—Three of Clubs—see a gigantic comb walk- \ning the beat like a cop (law—5), or a policeman is ar- \nresting a comb, and so on. \nWhen you are demonstrating this for your friends, have \nthe peg word for # 1 in your mind before he starts calling \nthe cards. As soon as you hear the first one, associate the \ncard word for that particular card with the peg word, \"tie.\" \nThen immediately get the peg word for #2 in your mind, \netc. When you've memorized the entire deck in this fash- \nion, call the cards off in order, from one to fifty-two! You \ncan have your friend call any number and you tell him the \ncard at that position, or, have him call any card and you tell \nhim at which number it is in the deck. \nOf course, you don't have to memorize the entire deck \nto impress your friends. If you wish to present a faster \ndemonstration, you can remember half the deck. This is \njust as effective, because it is just about impossible for any- \none with an untrained memory to remember twenty-six \ncards, in and out of order. \nHowever, if it is a fast demonstration you want, the one \nthat follows is the fastest, most impressive, and yet, the \neasiest of them all! This is called the \"missing card\" stunt. \nYou have anyone remove, say, five or six cards from a com- \nplete deck, and have them put them in a pocket. Now, let \nyour friend call the remaining cards to you at a fairly rapid \npace. After he has called all of them, you tell him the \nnames of the five or six missing cards!! \nItold you that this was easy to accomplish, and it is. \nHere is all you have to do:— As soon as a card is called, \ntranspose it to the representative card peg word, and then— \nmutilate that object in some way! That's it! Let me explain. \nAssume that the Four of Hearts is called—just \"sec\" a pic- \nture of a hare with no ears. If the Five of Diamonds is \n88 Playing Cards  \ncalled, see a doll with an arm or leg missing. If you hear the \nKing of Diamonds, see a spilled drink. That's all you have \nto do. Don't linger over your associations, just see the pic- \nture for the merest fraction of a second, and you're ready \nfor the next card. \nThis can be done quickly because you are cutting out one \nmental calisthenic, so to speak. You're not using your num- \nber pegs at all. Of course, the speed with which the cards \ncan be called is just a matter of practice. I can assure you \nthat after a while, you will practically \"see\" the picture in \nyour mind, before your friend is through naming the card! \nNow—after all the cards have been called, go over the \nwords for the cards in your mind. The best way to do this, \nis to go from Ace to King of one suit at a time. When you \ncome to an object that is not mutilated or broken in any \nway, that must be one of the missing cards! For example, \nyou start down your list of words for the Club cards: cat— \nyou had pictured the cat without a tail. Can—you had seen \natin can that was crushed. Comb—you had pictured a \ncomb with all its teeth missing or broken. Core—you do \nnot recall anything wrong with the core, therefore, the Four \nof Clubs is one of the missing cards. The unmutilated \nwords will stand out in your mind like a sore thumb as soon \nas you come to them. You need only try it once, to be con- \nvinced. \nIsuggest that you always use the same suit order when \ngoing over your card words mentally. It doesn't matter \nwhich order you use, as long as you can remember it easily. I \nuse, Clubs, Hearts, Spades and Diamonds because it's easy \nto remember. Just think of the word,—CHaSeD. If you \nwanted to use Hearts, Spades, Diamonds and Clubs order, \nyou could remember that, by thinking of the phrase— \nHiS DeCk. \nPlaying Cards  89 \nIncidentally, if you wanted to demonstrate your Bridge \nplaying technique, you could do the missing card stunt with \nthirteen missing cards. The amount of cards taken from \nthe deck before the deck is called to you doesn't make any \ndifference. You could even have half the deck called, and \nthen name all the cards in the other half! \nAfter my own performances, I think that the thing my \naudiences talk about the most, except perhaps names and \nfaces, are the card demonstrations that I do. They are very \nimpressive to most people, whether or not they play cards. \nI'm sure that most of you have read this far without ac- \ntually learning the card words. Now that you see the things \nyou can do with them, I hope you will learn them. By the \nway, do any of you see how you can apply the missing card \nidea to games like Gin Rummy, Bridge, Pinochle, Casino, \nor for that matter, to any game where it is to your advantage \nto know which cards have or haven't been played? I will \nleave that to you. \nIn a later chapter, you will find some more stunts and \nideas with cards. However, one more thought before I close \nthis chapter—If you wanted to remember a deck of cards \nin order only, you could do it quickly by using the Link \nmethod alone! You would simply link the card pegs to each \nother as they were called. Of course, you wouldn't know \nthem out of sequence with this method. \nIkeep telling you to have the cards called off to you; but \nit's just as good to look at the cards to remember them. It \njust adds a little to the effect upon your spectators, if you \ndo not look at them. \nAfter going over the card words mentally, a few times, \nyou can use a deck of cards to help you practice. Shuffle the \ndeck, turn the cards face up, one at a time, calling out or \nthinking of the peg word for each one. When you can go \n90 Playing Cards \nthrough the entire deck at a fairly brisk pace without hesi- \ntating, then you know your card words. \nAnd when you do, would you try your new found ability \non test #4 in Chapter #3? I think you will be pleased at \nthe difference in your scores. \nIt Pays to Remember Long Digit Numbers  \nThe memory is a treasurer to whom we must give funds, if we \nare to draw the assistance we need. \n—Rowe \nonce, during my performance at the Concord Hotel in \nupstate New York, a \"friend\" in the audience asked me to \nmemorize the number, 414,233,442,475,059,125. I did, of \ncourse, using my systems. The reason I mention this now, \nis because I had forgotten the little stunt I used as a child. \nIwould boast to my friends of what a marvelous memory I \nhad, and ask one of the boys (a stooge, of course) to call \nout a long digit number. He would then proceed to call out \nthe subway stops of the New York Sixth Avenue Subway. \nWe all knew these stops, and it would have been quite ob- \nvious if he had said, \"4,\" then \"14\" and then \"23,\" and so \non. However, hearing the numbers in groups of three made \nthem unrecognizable to the uninitiated. \nIn those days the Sixth Ave. express stopped at West 4th \nStreet, then 14th Street, 23rd Street, 34th Street, 42nd \nStreet, 47th and 50th Streets, 59th Street, 125th Street, etc. \nIwould simply call off these stops and leave my pals ex- \nclaiming over my prodigious memory. This all proves that \nnumbers can be remembered if they are made to represent \nor mean something to us. I have helped you to do just that \n91 \n92 Long Digit Numbers \nby utilizing the peg system. Now, any number, whether it \nrepresents subway stops or not, can be made to mean some- \nthing to you. And, in my personal opinion, that is the only \nway to memorize and retain a number. Yes, I've heard of \nthe few rare cases of people who could memorize numbers \ninstantly. I've heard of one person who could remember \nand retain long numbers as they were flashed before his \neyes. (I wish I could do it!) These people don't know how \nthey remember, they just do. Unfortunately, these are the \nfew exceptions that strengthen my belief. \nHow would you go about memorizing the number 522- \n641637527? Here is the way a memory expert of the 19th \ncentury did it. He told his students to separate the number \ninto four sections of three digits each: 522 641 637 527. \nNow, I quote:— \n\"bring the first and fourth groups into relation, and you \nsee at once that the fourth group is larger than the first by \nonly five. Bringing the second group into relation with the \nthird section, we find they differ only by four. Again, the \nthird group is larger than the fourth by 100 and by 10, that \nis 527 becomes 637, the seven alone remaining steadfast. \nBeginning with the fourth group and passing to the third, \nwe have the fourth group with no added. The second \ngroup is the third group with only four added, and the first \ngroup is the fourth group with only five subtracted.\" \nThis system, without any modification is also taught by \nsome modern memory experts. When I first heard of the \nabove method of memorizing numbers, I felt that one \nwould have to have a trained memory in the first place, just \nto remember the instructions! As far as retaining the num- \nber is concerned—well, I think it highly improbable that \nyou would retain it for any length of time—if you memo- \nrized it at all. There were no ridiculous pictures or associa- \ntions made to remind you of it. I believe, however, that I \nLong Digit Numbers  93 \nsee the point that these memory experts were probably \ndriving at. If you do try to follow their instructions, you \nmust concentrate on the number. This, of course, is half \nthe battle won. Any method that forces the student to be \ninterested in, and to observe the number, and to concen- \ntrate on it, must meet with some success. It's just that it is \ntoo much like swatting a fly with a sledge hammer; the \nmeans are almost too burdensome to justify the end. \nThe Peg system of memorizing long digit numbers is \nactually a combination of the Peg and the Link methods. It \nforces you to concentrate on the number; it is easy to do— \nand the retentiveness is amazing! If you have learned the \nlist of Peg words from 1 to 100 this should be a cinch for \nyou. If you haven't learned them yet, this will make you \nwant to do so. For the time being, you can make up the \nwords as you go along. I'll use the same number as used \nabove to explain the method. \nFirst, let's break the number down into two digit num- \nbers. 52 26 41 63 75 27. Now, each of these two digit num- \nbers should represent or suggest a peg word to you:— \n52 26 41 63 75 27 \nlion         notch         rod         chum         coal         neck \nAll you have to do is to make a link of the six peg words! \nOr, any words you happen to be using. Picture a lion with a \nlarge notch in him. Picture yourself whittling notches into \nagigantic curtain rod. See yourself throwing your arms \naround the rod as if it were your chum, or, your chum is \nbeing used for a curtain rod. Picture yourself embracing a \nlarge piece of coal as if it were your chum; and, finally, see \nyourself or anyone with his neck made of coal. \nYou should be able to make this link in about thirty sec- \nonds. After you've made it, go over it once or twice in your \nmind to see if you've memorized it. In repeating the num- \n94 Long Digit Numbers \nber, all you do is transpose your peg words back to numbers. \nYou'll know the number now, forwards and backwards! In \nactual practice, you should form your peg words and link \nthem as you move your eyes from left to right across the \nnumber. \nThere you have it! You merely linked six objects to mem- \norize twelve digits, and you will retain them for as long as \nyou desire. If you have tried this while I explained it, and \nif you remember the number, you should feel proud of \nyourself. I say this because, according to some of our in- \ntelligence quotient tests, the average adult should remem- \nber a six digit number forwards and backwards, after hear- \ning or seeing it once. The superior adult should do the \nsame with an eight digit number. You've just accomplished \nit with a twelve digit number, and there is no limit to the \nretentiveness. \nDon't let anyone talk you out of it, either, by telling you \n\"no fair\" because you used a \"system.\" Those that do say \nthis, are surely envious of you because they can't do it, \nsystem or not. There are always those that scream, \"It's \nunnatural to remember with a system; you have to do it by \nnormal memory.\" Well, who's to say that this method is \nunnatural? It is surely more natural to remember than to \nforget. And, by using any of my systems you're simply aid- \ning your true memory! As I explained earlier, anything that \nanyone remembers must be associated to something they \nalready know and remember. People do it all the time, \nsometimes consciously, sometimes without realizing it— \nall we are doing is systemizing it. There's a \"method\" to \nour madness! Those that say memory systems are unnat- \nural, really mean, I think, that they don't know about them, \nor how to use them. \nNow that I've defended your recently acquired facility \nto remember, let's go a step further. If you've grasped the \nLong Digit Numbers  95 \nidea, which I'm sure you have, why not use your imagina- \ntion and make it even easier. If you like, you can link only \nfour words in order to memorize a twelve digit number. \nJust make up words to fit three of the digits at a time, and \nlink those. For example, you could picture a bolt of linen \n(522) riding a chariot (641) which is dragging a shoemaker \n(637—the last consonant sound is disregarded since you \nknow that the word represents only three digits) who is \nvery lanky (527). \nHere is another example:— \n994 614 757 954 \npaper ashtray clock bowler \nIf a long digit number that you wish to remember falls \ninto line for words that fit four digits at a time—why not \nuse them! In that way you can sometimes memorize and \nretain a twenty digit number, by linking only five words:— \n42109483521461279071 \nDoesn't that number look formidable? It sure does! But \nlook at it now:— \n4210 9483 5214 6127 9071 \nrents perfume launder cheating basket \n96 Long Digit Numbers  \nLink rents to perfume, perfume to launder, launder to \ncheating, cheating to basket—and you've memorized a \ntwenty digit number! \nIf, in your particular business, you find it necessary to \nmemorize long numbers very often, you'll soon use the first \nword that pops into your mind to fit either the first two, \nthree or four digits. There is no rule that says you must use \nwords to fit the same amount of digits in any long digit \nnumber. To memorize the number quickly, you use any \nwords at all—usually you will have time to think for a mo- \nment to find the best words for the number to be memo- \nrized. I have to leave this to your own imagination. How- \never, until you've become proficient at it, I would suggest \nthat you use the peg words for two digits at a time. \nYou can see now, the importance of knowing the ten \nbasic sounds of the phonetic alphabet thoroughly. If you \nhaven't learned them yet, re-read the chapter on how to \nlearn and practice them. If you are not sure of how to make \nridiculous or illogical associations—re-read that chapter. If \nyou do know the sounds, the peg words and how to make \nyour associations, try your knowledge on test # 3, in Chap- \nter # 3, and see the progress you've made. \nSome Pegs for Emergencies  \nThe memory is always present; ready and anxious to help—if \nonly we would ask it to do so more often. \n—Roger Broille \nmany times when I've been challenged to prove that any- \none can remember by using something similar to the Peg \nsystem—I would use a method which taught the skeptic \nto memorize ten miscellaneous objects forwards and back- \nwards, and in and out of order, in about five minutes. What \nIdid was to put ten small items, in a row, on a table; items \nlike a ring, a watch, a cigarette, a match book, a comb, etc. \nIthen told the person that these ten objects were to repre- \nsent the numbers from one to ten. \nNow I taught him to associate the item I called to the \nobject on the table which represented the number called. \nIn other words, if I called \"typewriter\" as #7, and the sev- \nenth item on the table was the ring; he would associate \n\"typewriter\" to ring. Later on, when I asked if he remem- \nbered #7, he would count to the seventh object, the ring, \nwhich would remind him of the typewriter. \nThis usually convinced the skeptic that he could remem- \nber better than he thought he could, but he always wanted \nto know if he'd have to carry those ten items with him. Of \ncourse, if he memorized those ten things he would have \n97 \n98 Some Pegs for Emergencies  \nhad a list of ten pegs to which to associate any other ten \nobjects. But, it is a bit difficult to memorize ten completely \nunassociated items to use for a peg list; and, in this case, \nwould hardly be worth the trouble. \nHowever, as I mention elsewhere in the book, it was \nSimonides who first used the rooms of his house, and the \nfurniture in the rooms as a peg list. And, this idea will work \njust as well today, except that it is a bit limited. Also there \nis too much sameness in pieces of furniture to make a use- \nful list. There is the possibility of becoming confused, and, \nit would take time to know which number each piece repre- \nsented. \nThere have been a great many ideas thought up on how \nto devise peg lists. I've heard of one man who used twenty- \nsix women that he knew, whose names each began with a \ndifferent letter of the alphabet. This gave him a list of \ntwenty-six pegs. If he wanted to remember that, say, type- \nwriter, was #16, he would associate typewriter to Pauline. \nThis will work; but again—too much sameness; each peg \nmust create a distinctly different picture in your mind if it \nis to work properly. \nThere are some ideas besides the phonetic alphabet \nwhich can be used just as well, except that they are limited \nin length. For instance, I have had occasion to need a few \nshort peg lists to help me recall up to twenty or twenty-six \nitems. Well, there are two methods that I've used quite \noften. The first is to use the twenty-six letters of the alpha- \nbet. All you have to do is to make up a word for each letter \nwhich sounds like the letter itself. Look at this list:— \nA—ape N — hen \nB—bean O — eau (water) \nC—sea P — pea \nD—dean Q — cute \nE—eel R — hour (clock) \nSome Pegs for Emergencies  99 \nF—effort (or effer-  S — ass \nvescent)  T — tea \nG—jean (or Gee, U — ewe \ncommand to horse) V — veal \nH—ache                                        W — Waterloo \nI—eye X — eggs \nJ—jail Y — wine \nK—cake Z — zebra \nL—el (elevated train) \nM—ham \nIf you go over this list once or twice, you'll have it. De- \ncide on a picture for each one, and use that all the time. \nNow you have a list which will enable you to memorize up \nto twenty-six objects. For \"B,\" I used \"bean\" only because \n\"bee\" would conflict with your basic peg word for #9. Of \ncourse, there are other words that can fit for some letters, \nand you can use any that you like. Just be sure that they \ndo not conflict with your basic list of pegs. The words listed \nabove are the ones that I use. \nIncidentally, if you made a link from zebra to ape, you \nwould be able to recite the alphabet backwards, which is \nquite a feat in itself. If you want to, you can associate each \nletter word to your regular peg word for that particular num- \nber. In this way you would know the numerical position of \neach letter immediately:—ape to \"tie\"; bean to \"Noah\"; \nsea to \"ma,\" and dean to \"rye,\" etc. \nAnother idea I use is to make a list of nouns, each of \nwhich look like the number they represent. You can do this \nwith many numbers, and for those that you can't, you can \nmake up any picture to remind you of it. For #1, you \nmight picture a pencil, because a pencil standing upright \nlooks like the numeral one. For #2, you can picture a swan; \naswan on a lake is shaped something like the numeral \ntwo. I usually picture a three leaf clover for #3. A table \nor chair, or anything with four legs can represent #4. For \n100 Some Pegs for Emergencies  \n#5, you can see a five pointed star. A yo-yo on a string, with \nalittle stretch of the imagination, looks like a numeral six. \nAgolf club held upside down is similar in shape to #7. \nFor #8, you could picture an hourglass. For #9, I use a \ntape measure. I mean the tape measures that are made of \nmetal and unroll from a round container. If you pull the \ntape out about six inches, the thing looks like a numeral \nnine. A bat and ball pictured side by side can represent \n#10; the bat is the digit 1, and the ball is the zero. I pic- \nture spaghetti for #11; my original picture was of two \npieces of raw spaghetti lying side by side, which looked like \n#11. For #12, you can think of 12:00 o'clock and picture \naclock. \nYou can use either a black cat or walking under a ladder \nfor #13. My original picture for #14, was a straight run- \nning river or stream to represent the 1, and a farm that \nlooked like the numeral four from the air. If you can create \nthis picture in your mind—looking from an airplane and \n\nSome Pegs for Emergencies  101 \nseeing this farm adjacent to the river, they would look like \nthe #14. You can then use either farm or river, or both, \nto represent the number. \nIpictured myself stepping into an elevator and saying, \n\"Fifteenth floor, please,\" for #15. I now use elevator to \nrepresent the number. For #16, I pictured a road sign that \nsaid, \"Route 16.\" \nIhave used this list for years, to help me memorize six- \nteen objects. There is no reason for you to stop at sixteen. \nYou can use the same idea to bring the list up to twenty, or \nhigher if you like. No thought or picture is too far fetched, \nif it suggests a certain number to you, then it will serve the \npurpose. Just get your imagination working. \nAnyway, here is the list as I've used it, up to #16:— \n \n1—pencil                   9 — tape measure \n2—swan                  10 — bat and/or ball \n3—clover                  11 — spaghetti \n4—table                    12 — clock \n5—star                    13 — black cat (or ladder) \n6—yo-yo                 14 — farm (or river) \n7—golf club             15 — elevator \n8—hourglass             16 — sign  \nThere are other ideas which I could list; but I won't. If \nyou need any more lists, you can use your imagination to \nhelp you form them. I'm sure you realize that the phonetic \nalphabet, and the letter or number equivalent method \ntaught in this book, is far superior to any of the methods \nmentioned in this chapter. Your basic list of peg words can \nbe brought up to a thousand, or over, if you wanted to, and \nthe beauty of it is that as soon as you heard one of them, \nthe sounds in the word would tell you immediately which \nnumber it represented. The phonetic alphabet makes it \npossible for peg words to be at your fingertips for any num- \n1O2 Some Pegs for Emergencies  \nber; you don't have to make them up and remember them \nin advance, either, you can make them up when, or as, you \nneed them. \nThe two ideas I've suggested to you here, however, can \nbe useful if you need a short list quickly, or, if you want to \nuse one of them in conjunction with your basic peg words. \nThe latter idea can be used for some amazing memory feats, \nas you will learn in a later chapter. \nBefore closing this chapter, I just want to remind you \nagain that none of these ideas arc too far fetched. Any one \nof them will work for you if you make up your mind to use \nthem. The two listed here, are as far as I'm concerned, the \nbest of the lot; but any list of words that you happen to \nknow in sequence, can serve as a peg list. I know one man \nwho uses his own body for this purpose. From head down, \nhe uses, hair, forehead, eyes, nose, mouth, chin, neck, chest, \nall the way down to toe, for his peg list. So, if an object to \nbe remembered were #3, he would associate it to \"eyes,\" \nif it were #7, he would associate it to \"neck,\" and so on. \nSome of the old time memory experts who performed in \nvaudeville would use the theatre itself to help them do the \nstunt of memorizing objects called by the audience. They \nmight have used the stage for #1, the footlights for #2, \nthe orchestra for #3, divans for #4, balcony for #5, etc. \nAnything in the theatre was utilized; the draperies, chande- \nliers, exit signs, men's room, ladies' room, etc. \nAnd, of course, one of the most common, (and most lim- \nited) peg lists is the one which uses words that sound like \nthe numbers. Such as, gun for one, shoe for two, tree for \nthree, door for four, and so on, up to hen for ten, which is \nabout as far as you can go. \nWell, I guess my main reason for telling you about all \nthese other ideas for word lists, was to show off the effective- \nness of the phonetic alphabet. As far as I know, there is no \nSome Pegs for Emergencies  103 \nother idea that approaches it for its unlimited qualities and \nfor its versatility. \nIn the next chapter you will see how either one of the \nlists you learned here, or parts of them, can be used in con- \njunction with the phonetic alphabet. \nIt Pays to Remember Dates  \n\"What day is today?\" \n\"Gosh, you've got me, I don't know what day it is.\" \n\"Well, why don't you look at that newspaper you have in \nyour pocket—that should tell us.\" \n\"Oh, no, that won't do us any good; it's yesterday's paper!\" \nalthough all of us can tell what day today is by looking \nat yesterday's paper—how many of you can tell quickly, or \nslowly, for that matter, the day of the week that any date \nthis year will fall on? Not many, I'm sure. If you feel that \nhaving this information at your fingertips, with hardly any \neffort, is worthwhile—then read on. There are, of course, \nmany different methods for calculating the day of the \nweek for any given date, not the least of which is counting \non your fingers. \nSome of the systems are so involved that it seems much \nsimpler to take the time to find a calendar, and get your \ninformation there. On the other hand, there are ways of \nactually knowing the day of the week for any date in the \ntwentieth century! This doesn't seem to me to have any \nparticular practical value; although it may have for some of \nyou. Used as a memory stunt, however, it is quite impres- \nsive. \nIintend to teach you how to do that in this chapter, but \n104 \nIt Pays to Remember Dates  105 \nfirst, for practical use, I have come across a very simple way \nto find the day of the week for any date of the current \nyear. This idea is so easy, that most of you will wonder why \nyou didn't think of it yourselves. This is it:— \nAll you have to do is memorize this twelve digit num- \nber:— 633752741631, the way you've been taught to do. \nYou can break the digits down into your peg words and \nlink them, or make up words to take in more than two digits \nat a time. For example, you can remember this number by \nmaking a link of these four words, chum, mug, linger and \ndishmat. Once you have memorized the number, you can \ntell the day of the week for any date of the year 1957! Each \ndigit in the number represents the first Sunday of the month \nfor one of the twelve months! The first Sunday in January \nfalls on the 6th of January; the first Sunday in February falls \non the 3rd of February; the first Sunday in March is the 3rd \nof March; April 7th is the first Sunday in April; May 5th is \nthe first Sunday in May, and so on. \nAll right, so now you know the day of the month upon \nwhich the first Sunday falls for each month. How can this \nhelp you to know the day of the week for any date of the \ncurrent year? Simple! You wish to know the day of the week \nfor August 22nd, 1957—you know that the first Sunday of \nAugust is the 4th of the month. Knowing this, your calcula- \ntions are elementary. If the 4th is a Sunday, then the next \nSunday is the nth and the following Sunday, the 18th. The \n18th is a Sunday, so the 19th is Monday, the 2oth is Tues- \nday, the 21st is Wednesday, and, of course, August 22nd is a \nThursday! \nDo you want to know the day of the week on which \nChristmas falls this year (1957)? Well, thanks to the twelve \ndigit number, you know that the first Sunday of December \nis the 1st of the month. Therefore the 8th must be a Sunday, \nthe 15th is a Sunday, and the 22nd is a Sunday. If the 22nd \n106 It Pays to Remember Dates  \nof December is a Sunday, then the 23rd is Monday, the 24th \nis Tuesday, and the 25th of December (Christmas) must \nfall on Wednesday this year! \nHere is the way my mind actually works when I want the \nday of the week for any date this year:— I use the words, \nchum, mug, linger and dishmat to remember the twelve \ndigits. I know that the word, \"chum,\" gives me the first \nSunday of the month for January and February. The word, \n\"mug\" tells me the first Sunday of March and April. \"Lin- \nger\" gives me the same information for May, June, July and \nAugust, and I know that \"dishmat\" represents September, \nOctober, November and December. \nNow, if I wanted to know the day of the week for, say, \nNovember 9, 1957—I immediately think of \"dishmat.\" I \nknow that the third consonant sound of this word represents \nthe first Sunday of November. The first Sunday is the 3rd, \ntherefore the loth of November is also a Sunday; and, if the \nloth is a Sunday, the 9th of November must be a Saturday. \nIf, in your particular business, it would be a help if you \nknew the day of the week for the present year and the fol- \nlowing year—get a hold of next year's calendar, and memo- \nrize the twelve digits for that year by making up a link of \nfour or five words. You could do this for as many years as \nyou want to, but I don't believe it's practical for more than \ntwo years. However, the memory feat that follows is also a \npractical method of knowing the day of the week for any \ndate in the twentieth century. \nAs a stunt, you would tell your friends that you've memo- \nrized all the calendars of the twentieth century. To prove \nit, ask them to call out any date; a date of which they them- \nselves know the day of the week. This is necessary, of \ncourse, so that they can check your answer. Most people \nremember the day of the week of their weddings, gradua- \ntions or other important anniversaries. When the date is \nIt Pays to Remember Dates  107 \ncalled, you almost immediately tell them the day of the \nweek for that particular date! \nTo accomplish this you must know two things besides \nthe month, day and year: a certain number for the year, \nwhich I will refer to as the \"year key,\" and a certain num- \nber for the month, which I'll call the \"month key.\" \nPerhaps, if I explained the method and procedure be- \nfore going into the technicalities, you would find it easier \nto understand. This is it:— Let's assume that you want to \nknow the day of the week for March 27, 1913. Let's also \nassume that you know the \"year key\" for 1913 is 2, and \nthat the \"month key\" for March is 4. You would add these \ntwo keys, arriving at #6. Now you add this number (6) to \nthe day, in this particular case—#27 (March 27). This \ngives you a total of 33. The last step is to remove all the \nsevens from your total. Seven goes into 33 four times, \n(4X7== 28); remove 28 from 33, which gives you a final \ntotal of 5. That is your day—the fifth day of the week is \nThursday! For this stunt we must consider Sunday as the \nfirst day, Monday the second day; Tuesday the third day; \nWednesday the fourth day; Thursday the fifth day; Friday \nthe sixth day and Saturday the seventh day. \nMarch 27, 1913 did fall on a Thursday! Please don't con- \nsider this complicated; it isn't. Actually you will never have \nto add any numbers higher than seven. The keys for the \nyears and the months are all either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. \nSevens are always removed as soon as possible. If you had \nto add a \"year key\" of 5 to a \"month key\" of 6, you would \narrive at 11; but immediately remove one seven, which \nleaves you with 4. The 4 is all you would have to keep work- \ning with. If the day that is given you is higher than seven, \nyou remove all the sevens, i.e.—the date is the 16th; re- \nmove the two sevens (2X7= 14) and use the remainder \nof 2 only. In the above example, you would simply add 4 to \n108 It Pays to Remember Dates \n2, which tells you that the day of the week is the sixth, \nor Friday. \nIwill give you a few more actual examples, after I ac- \nquaint you with the year and month keys, and my methods \nfor remembering them. \nThese are the month keys, which will always remain the \nsame:— \n \nJanuary — 1 \nFebruary — 4 \nMarch — 4 \nApril — 0 \nMay — 2 \nJune — 5  July — 0\nAugust — 3\nSeptember — 6\nOctober — 1\nNovember — 4\nDecember — 6 \nI'll give you a memory aid for remembering each of these \nkeys. The method that follows is one way, and I'll explain \none other. You can use whichever you like best, or one \nwhich you think of yourself. \nJanuary is the first month of the year; therefore it is easy \nto recall that the key for January is 1. \nFebruary is a cold month, it usually has plenty of snow; \nboth the words, \"cold\" and \"snow\" have four letters, so the \nkey for February is 4. \nIn March the wind Wows. Both \"wind\" and \"blow\" have \nfour letters; which will help you to remember that the key \nfor March is 4. \nApril is known for its showers. \"Showers\" has seven \nletters; all the sevens must be removed; (7 — 7 = 0) so we \nknow that the key for April is zero. \nThe key for May is 2. Do you recall the game we used to \nplay when we were children, the one in which we would say, \n\"May I take 2 giant steps?\" Well, if you remember that \nphrase, you will recall that the key for May is 2. Or, you \nIt Pays to Remember Dates  109 \nmight think of \"May Day\" or \"May Pole,\" consisting of \ntwo words. \n\"June Bride\" is a common phrase; \"bride\" has five letters, \nso you will remember that the key for June is # 5. \nFor July, you could use this for a memory aid:— We all \nknow that July 4th is a celebration of the signing of the \nDeclaration of Independence in 1776. Take the two sevens \nfrom the year 1776, leaving 1 and 6. One and six are seven; \nremove this seven, leaving 0. Or, July 4th is usually associ- \nated with fire crackers; the word \"cracker\" has seven letters; \nremove the seven, leaving 0. The key for July is zero. \nAugust is a hot month. The word \"hot\" has three letters; \nthe key for August is 3. \nSeptember is the month during which the leaves start \nturning brown. \"Leaves\" has six letters; the key for Septem- \nber is 6. \nOcto means eight, remove the seven (8 — 7 = 1) leaving \none. The key for October is 1. \nNovember is the election month. We vote in November; \nthe word, \"vote\" has four letters, so the key for November is \n4. Or, November is the nth month of the year, remove \nseven, leaving four. \nFinally, the big holiday in December is Christmas. \nChristmas is the anniversary of the birth of Christ. \n\"Christ\" has six letters, so we know that 6 is the key for \nDecember. \nAlthough some of the above may seem a bit far fetched, \nthey will help you remember the keys. Another way would \nbe to form a substitute word for each month, (the system of \nsubstitute words will be explained thoroughly in the follow- \ning chapter) and associate that to the peg word that repre- \nsents its key number. For zero, use any word that contains \nthe s or z sound only; \"zoo\" is good, because it is easy to \npicture. \n110 It Pays to Remember Dates  \nHere are some suggestions as to substitute words for all \ntwelve months:— \nJanuary—Jan.—Abbreviation of \"janitor.\" Associate jani- \ntor to \"tie.\" \nFebruary—Fed.—Federal man. Fib or fob. Associate any \nof these to \"rye.\" \nMarch—See the object associated (rye) marching. \nApril—Ape. \nMay—Use a person whose name is May, or picture a \nMaypole. \nJune—Picture a June Bride. \nJuly—Jewel. \nAugust—Gust of wind. Picture \"ma\" being blown about \nby a gust of wind. \nSeptember—Scepter or sipped. \nOctober—Octopus or oboe. \nNovember—Ember, new member. \nDecember—Decimal, deceased or descend. \nYou can use either one of the two methods, or one that \nyou come up with yourself. \nNow we come to the year keys. I'll give you all the keys \nfor the years 1900 to 1987. All the years that have 1 for a \nkey, are listed together; the years with 2, are listed together, \nand so on. \nIt Pays to Remember Dates  111 \nIwould suggest the use of another peg list to help you \nremember these keys. All you actually need is six words, \nrepresenting the numbers 1 to 6, which will not conflict \nwith your basic peg list. You can use any of the lists that I \nsuggested in the previous chapter; the alphabet idea; ape, \nbean, sea, etc., or, pencil, swan, clover, table, star, yo-yo, etc. \nFor zero, use \"zoo\" or \"sue.\" \nSince every year listed begins with 19, you don't have to \ntry to remember that. Just associate the peg word for the \nlast two digits of the year, to the word that you are using to \nrepresent the key numbers. \nFor instance, the key for 1941 is 2. Associate \"rod\" (41) \nto either \"swan\" or \"bean,\" according to the list you're \nusing. Make your associations for all of them. Go over them \nafew times, and before you know it, you'll have memorized \nthem all. \n \n1900 \n1906 \n1917 \n1923 \n1928 \n1934 \n1945 — 0 \n1951 \n1956 \n1962 \n1973 \n1979 \n1984  1901 \n1907 \n1912 \n1918 \n1929 \n1935 \n1940 — 1 \n1946 \n1957 \n1963 \n1968 \n1974 \n1985  1902 \n1913 \n1919 \n1924 \n1930 \n1941 \n1947 — 2 \n1952 \n1958 \n1969 \n1975 \n1980 \n1986  1903 \n1908 \n1914 \n1925 \n1931 \n1936 \n1942 — 3 \n1953 \n1959 \n1964 \n1970 \n1976 \n1981 \n1987  \n \n1909 \n191; \n1920 \n1926 \n1937 \n1943 — 4 \n1948 \n1954 1904 \n1910 \n1921 \n1927 \n1932 \n1938—5 \n1949 \n1955 1905 \n1911 \n1916 \n1922 \n1933 \n1939 — 6 \n1944 \n1950  \n \n112 It Pays to Remember Dates \n \n1965 \n1971 \n1982  1960 \n1966 \n1977 \n1983 1961 \n1967 \n1972 \n1978 \nYou now have all the information necessary to do the cal- \nendar stunt, except for one thing. If it is a leap year and the \ndate you are interested in is for either January or February \n—then the day of the week will be one day earlier than \nwhat your calculations tell you. For example:— If you \nwanted to find the day of the week for February 15th, \n1944:— The key for 1944 is 6- Add this to the key for Feb- \nruary, which is 4, to get a total of 10. Remove the seven, \nleaving 3. Add the 3 to the day minus the sevens, (15th \nday minus 14) which is 3 plus one, giving you a final total \nof 4. Four would ordinarily represent Wednesday, but in \nthis case, you know that it is actually one day earlier, or \nTuesday. \nRemember that you do this only for January and Febru- \nary of a leap year. You can tell if a year is a leap year by \ndividing four into the last two digits. If four goes in evenly, \nwith no remainder, then it is a leap year. (1944—4 into 44 \nis 11, no remainder). The year 1900 is not a leap year. \nTwo more examples of the system:— \nJune 2, 1923 — 0  plus 5 is 5 \n5plus 2 is 7 \n7minus 7 is 0 \n0is Saturday. \nJanuary 29, 1937 —   4   plus 1 is 5 \n5plus 29 is 34 \n34  minus 28 (4 X 7) is 6 \n6is Friday. \nSee if you can find the day of the week for the following \ndates:— September 9, 1906, January 18, 1916 (leap year), \nAugust 20, 1974, March 12, 1931 and December 25, 1921. \nIdon't intend to tell you that this system is a snap to \nIt Pays to Remember Dates  113 \nlearn to do quickly; it does take some time and study, but, \nas I'm sure most of you know—nothing worthwhile comes \ntoo easily. \nBy the way, if you like this idea better than the one at the \nbeginning of this chapter, and would like to use it for prac- \ntical purposes—you could remember the \"year keys\" of only \nthe years you're interested in. That might be the previous \nyear, the present year and the following year. With that, \nand your \"month keys,\" you would be able to know the day \nof the week for any date within those three years. \nIt Pays to Remember Foreign Language \nVocabulary and Abstract Information  \nThe more intelligible a thing is, the more easily it is retained in \nthe memory, and contrariwise, the less intelligible it is, the more \neasily we forget it. \n—Benedict Spinoza \nYou may not think that the above quote shows any particu- \nlar brilliance on the part of Mr. Spinoza. You may feel, \n\"Sure, anyone knows that if something is intelligible, or \nmakes sense, it is easier to remember.\" Well, that's true, \nit is an obvious thought, but it took Mr. Spinoza to say it, \nor put it down on paper just that way, as far back as the \n17th century. \nI'm making a fuss about this particular quote because it \ntells you in one sentence what this entire book is about. Al- \nmost all the systems in the book are basically that—they \nhelp make unintelligible things intelligible. One example, \nof course, is the Peg system; numbers by themselves are \nusually unintelligible, but the use of the Peg system makes \nthem mean something to you. \nPerhaps the best example is in trying to memorize for- \neign language vocabulary. A word in a foreign language is \nnothing but a conglomeration of sounds to anyone who is \n114 \nForeign Language Vocabulary & Abstract Information  115 \nnot familiar with the language. That's why they're so diffi- \ncult to remember. \nTo make them easier to remember you will use the sys- \ntem of SUBSTITUTE WORDS. Substitute words or \nthoughts are used whenever you want to remember any- \nthing that is abstract, intangible or unintelligible; some- \nthing that makes no sense to you, can't be pictured, yet \nmust be remembered. Be sure you read this chapter care- \nfully, because substitute words will also help you to remem- \nber names. \nMaking up a substitute word is simply this:— Upon \ncoming across a word that means nothing to you; that is in- \ntangible and unintelligible, you merely find a word, phrase \nor thought that sounds as close to it as possible, and that is \ntangible and can be pictured in your mind. \nAny word you may have to remember, foreign language \nor otherwise, that is meaningless, can be made to mean \nsomething to you by utilizing a substitute word or thought. \nYears ago I was a tropical fish hobbyist for awhile, and I was \ntrying to learn the technical names of the fish fins. Since I \ncouldn't picture their names at that time, I used substitute \nwords to remember them. \nFor example:— The tail fin of a fish is called the caudal \nfin. In order to remember this, I made a picture of a fish \nwith a long cord instead of a tail fin. The picture of a cord \nwas enough to help me recall the word, \"caudal.\" The fin \non the back of the fish is known as the dorsal fin. The first \nthought that came to my mind when I heard, \"dorsal,\" was \nTommy Dorsey. (dorsal-Dorsey) I automatically associate \nTommy Dorsey with a trombone. So, I simply made a pic- \nture in my mind of a man playing a trombone on the fish's \nback! \nThis may sound like a long procedure to you; it isn't. \nThe association from \"dorsal\" to Tommy Dorsey to trom- \n116     Foreign Language Vocabulary & Abstract Information \nbone to the actual forming of the picture is the work of the \nmerest fraction of a second. The thing for you to keep in \nmind is that the thought or picture that comes to you when \nyou hear any intangible word, is the one to use. I used \nDorsey for dorsal, but you, perhaps, would have thought of \n\"door-sill,\" which would have served the purpose just as \nwell. \nThe Spanish word for \"bird\" is \"pajaro,\" (pronounced \npa-kar-ro). Can you think of a substitute word for it? It's \neasy, because the word almost sounds like \"parked car.\" \nParked car, of course, is something that is tangible and \nwhich you can picture in your mind. So—why not make a \nridiculous or illogical association, as you've already learned, \nbetween \"parked car\" and \"bird\"? You might \"see\" a \nparked car crammed full of birds, or a bird parking a car, \netc. \nThe next time you try to recall the Spanish word for \n\"bird,\" your ridiculous association will help you to recall \nthat the word is \"pajaro.\" The substitute word you select \ndoes not have to sound exactly like the foreign word you're \ntrying to remember. For \"pajaro,\" you might have used pa \ncarrying eau (water), or, parks in a row, either of which \nwould have also helped you to remember the word. As long \nForeign Language Vocabulary & Abstract Information  117 \nas you have the main part of the word in your picture, the \nincidentals, the rest of the word, will fall into place by true \nmemory. \nThis is strictly an individual thing; there are some sub- \nstitute thoughts I use that I couldn't possibly explain in \nwords, but they do help me recall the foreign word. The \nwords I use may be great for me, but not for you; you must \nuse the substitute thoughts that you think of. \nIam explaining this so thoroughly because it is one of the \nmost useful things you will learn in this book, and I want \nyou to understand just what I'm talking about. To remem- \nber a foreign word and its English meaning, associate the \nEnglish meaning to your substitute word for the foreign \nword. \nLet me give you some concrete examples of the system, \nusing a few simple Spanish and French words:— \nVentana means \"window\" in Spanish. You might picture \nagirl (one you know) whose name is Anna, throwing a \nvent through a closed window. If you wanted to remember \nthe French word for window, which is \"fenetre,\" you might \npicture a window eating a raw fan, or a fan eating a raw \nwindow. Fan-ate-raw—fenetre! \nThe Spanish word, hermano (pronounced air-mon-o) \nmeans \"brother.\" Just picture your brother as an airman. \nThe Spanish word for \"room\" is cuarto (pronounced \nquart-o). Picture a room piled high with quarters. \nVasa means \"glass\" in Spanish. See yourself drinking \nfrom a vase instead of a glass. \nThe word for \"bridge\" in French, is pont. See yourself \npunting a football on or over a bridge. \nPluma means \"pen\" in Spanish. See yourself writing with \nagigantic plume instead of a pen; or, you're writing on a \nplume with a pen. \n118     Foreign Language Vocabulary & Abstract Information  \nThe word meaning \"father\" in French, is pere. Associate \nfather to pear and you'll always remember it. \nThe sample associations given above are those that I \nmight use, it is always best to make up your own pictures. \nTry this method with any foreign language vocabulary, \nand you'll be able to memorize the words better and faster, \nand with more retentiveness, than you ever could before. \nAside from languages, this system can be used for anything \nyou may be studying which entails remembering words \nthat have no meaning to you, at first. A medical student \nwho has to memorize the names of the bones in the human \nbody, may have some trouble with femur, coccyx, patella, \nfibula, sacrum, etc. But if these were made into substitute \nwords or thoughts like this:—fee more—femur; rooster \n(cock) kicks or cock sics—coccyx; pay teller or pat Ella— \npatella; fib you lie—fibula; and, sack of rum—sacrum— \nthen the student could link them to each other, or associate \nthem to whatever it is they must be associated to. \nApharmaceutical student could picture someone push- \ning a large bell down over him while he throws pine trees \nfrom under it, to help him remember that atropine (I \nthrow pine) comes from the belladonna (bell down) root \nor leaf. \nIam actually making up these substitute words as I write; \nwith a little thought you could find much better substitute \nwords for them. You might want to picture a giver (donor) \nof a bell to remember belladonna, etc. \nThe point is that the substitute word or thought has \nmeaning while the original word does not. Therefore you \nmake it easier to remember by using the substitute word. \nYou will get some more pointers and practice on this in the \nchapter on how to remember names. \nSo—I started this chapter with a quote by Benedict \nSpinoza, may I be presumptuous enough to end it with a \nForeign Language Vocabulary & Abstract Information  119 \nquote of my own—\"Anything that is intangible, abstract or \nunintelligible can be remembered easily if a system is used \nwhereby the unintelligible thing is made to be tangible, \nmeaningful and intelligible.\" \nIt Pays to Remember Names and Faces  \nTwo men approached each other on the street with a look of \nrecognition in their eyes. One said to the other, \"Now wait a \nminute, don't tell me, I know I know you, but I'm not sure of \nwhere we met. Let me see if I can think of your name. I've got \nit! We met in Miami Beach two years ago.\" \n\"No, I've never been to Miami Beach.\" \n\"Hold it, don't tell me—oh, yes, it was on the boardwalk \nof Atlantic City that we met.\" \n\"Sorry, I've never visited Atlantic City.\" \n\"I've got it now! Chicago in 1953!\" \n\"Nope, I was not in Chicago in 1953.\" \n\"Well, I know we've met, where do I know you from?\" \n\"Idiot! I'm your brother!!\" \n\"OH, I know your face, but I just can't remember your \nname!\" \nAlthough I doubt if any of you are as bad as the fellow \nin the anecdote, how often have you been embarrassed \nbecause you had to say this? I'm sure it has happened to \nyou many times. If I were to take a poll as to why most \npeople want to take my memory course, I think it would \nshow that at least 80% want to because they can't seem to \nbe able to remember names and faces. \nUsually, of course, it is the name that has been forgotten, \n120 \nNames and Faces  121 \nnot the face. The reason for this is quite simple. You see, \nmost of us are what we call \"eye-minded.\" In other words, \nthings that we see register upon our brains with much more \nemphasis than what we hear. You always see the face, but \nusually only hear the person's name. That's why most of us, \ntime after time, have to say, \"I recognize your face, but I \ncan't remember your name.\" \nNot only can this be embarrassing, but can sometimes \nhurt in business, and ultimately cost you money. Some peo- \nple try to avoid this embarrassment by trying to trick people \ninto giving their names before they themselves realize that \ntheir name has been forgotten. This might work occasion- \nally, but not usually, and it still pays to remember the \nnames. I'm sure you have all heard the old story about the \nman who met a business acquaintance whose name he \ncouldn't recall. He tried to avoid embarrassment by pre- \ntending he knew the name, but wasn't sure of the spelling; \nso he asked, \"How do you spell your name again?\" The - \nreply was, \"The only way it can be spelled, J,O,N,E,S!\" \nYou see, this trick didn't work in this particular case. \nAnother sneaky way of pretending you didn't forget the \nname of someone you should have remembered, is this:— \nMerely ask the person what his name is. If he tells you his \nsecond name, you say, \"Oh, I wouldn't forget that, it's your \nfirst name I meant.\" If the person tells you the first name \nfirst, you, of course, say that you knew that, but it was the \nsecond name you wanted. In this way, you get the person's \nfull name, and it seems as if you only forgot one of the \nnames. There is only one thing wrong with this little bit \nof hocus-pocus. If the person gives you his full name as \nsoon as you ask for the name in the first place, you're out \nof luck. \nThen there is the classic example of the fellow who always \nasked people whose name he had forgotten, whether they \n122 Names and Faces \nspelled it with an e or an i. This was fine, until he tried \nit with Mrs. Hill. \nNo, I'm afraid it still pays to remember the name, instead \nof resorting to trickery. Not only does it pay to remember \nit, but believe me, it's easier than resorting to subterfuge \nbecause it takes much less effort. \nPeople have tried various systems and methods to help \ntheir memory for names. Some use the alphabet, or first \ninitial method. That is to say, they make a tremendous \neffort to retain only the initial of the person's name. This \nis more wasted effort, since they usually forget the initial \nanyway; and even if they remember the initial, how can \nthat tell them the person's name? If you address Mr. Adler \nas Mr. Armanjian, or vice versa, he isn't going to be pleased \njust because the name you called him has the same first \nletter as his own. \nAlthough writing things down on paper can sometimes \nbe helpful in remembering, it cannot be depended upon \nas far as memorizing names is concerned. In conjunction \nwith a good system of association—perhaps, as I will explain \nlater, but not by itself. If you were able to draw an exact \nreplica of the person's face, this would be better, since you \nwould then know which name belongs to which face. You'd \nhave your two tangibles with which to make some sort of \nridiculous association. But, unfortunately, most of us can't \ndraw that well, and if we could, it wouldn't be that helpful \nthat it would make up for the time it would take. \nSome memory teachers will tell their students to keep a \n\"memory book,\" and write down the name of every person \nthey want to remember. As I've said, this might help a \nlittle if used together with a good system of association, \nbut not otherwise. It might help some, of course, if you \nwanted to run down the list of names each time you meet \naperson, with the hope that the name will come to mind \nNames and Faces  123 \nwhen you see it written in your book. If it did, I don't \nthink you would feed the ego of the person whose name \nyou \"fished\" out of a book instead of out of your memory. \nIt isn't necessary, I'm sure, for me to tell you how im- \nportant it is to remember names and faces. Yet, here is one \nof the most common memory complaints of modern times: \n\"I just can't remember names!\" Our way of life today makes \nit almost unavoidable to meet many new people every day. \nYou meet people continually, people you want to remem- \nber, and people that you do not think are important enough \nto bother remembering until you meet them again. Then \nwhen it is too late, you realize that you should have tried \nto remember. \nWould it not be an asset for any salesman to remember \nthe names of his customers? Or for a doctor to remember \nthe names of his patients; a lawyer, his clients, etc.? Of \ncourse, it would. Everybody wants to be able to remember \nnames and faces, but many times an important sale is \nnipped in the bud, money is lost, someone is caused to be \nembarrassed or a reputation is stained, because someone \nforgot an important person's name. Yet, even as far back \nas early Greek and Roman civilization, Cicero remem- \nbered the names of thousands of his villagers and soldiers, \nby using a memory system. \nThere is a young lady that I've heard of, who is the hat \ncheck girl in a popular New York night club. She has gained \nareputation, because she never issues a check for your hat \nor coat. She simply remembers which hat or which coat \nbelongs to whom. It is said that she never yet has given \nanyone the wrong article. This may not seem so important \nto you, since it would be just as easy to do it with hat or \ncoat checks, the way all check-room attendants do it. But \nthis young lady has made herself into sort of an attraction \nat this night club, and her sizable tips prove it. Of course, \n124 Names and Faces  \nthis is not exactly remembering names and faces, since she \ndoesn't remember the name, but it is similar enough. She \nmust associate the hat or coat, or both, to the person's face. \nI've been told that the bellboy of a large hotel down south \nhas gained a similar reputation. Whenever someone checks \ninto the hotel that has been there even once before, this \nbellboy addresses them by name. The last I heard, he is \nwell on his way to saving enough money out of his tips \nto buy the hotel. \nThis should prove to you, if proof were necessary, that \npeople love to be remembered, they even pay for it. This \nparticular hat check girl and bellboy surely made more \nmoney than the others who worked at the same jobs. \nAperson's name is his most prized possession, and there \nis nothing more pleasing to him than hearing his own name \nor having it remembered by others. \nSome of my students and myself have remembered as \nmany as three hundred names and faces at one meeting; \nand you can do it too! \nBefore getting into the actual systems and methods for \nremembering names and faces, I'd like to show you how \nyou can improve your memory for them by at least 25% \nto 50% without the systems! Read the next few paragraphs \nvery carefully. \nThe main reason that most people forget a name is \nbecause they never remembered it in the first place! I'll \ntake that a step further, and say that they never even \nheard the name in the first place. How often have you \nbeen introduced to someone new, something like this: \"Mr. \nReader, meet Mr. Stra—ph—is\"? All you hear is a mumbled \nsound instead of the name. Possibly because the person \nwho is doing the introducing doesn't remember the name \nhimself. So, he resorts to double-talk. You, on the other \nhand, probably feel that you will never meet this person \nNames and Faces  125 \nagain, so, you say, \"Nice to meet you,\" and you never bother \nto get the name right. You may even spend some time talk- \ning to the person and finally say good-bye, and still not hear \nthe name properly. \nThe only thought most people will give to this situation, \nis a self-questioning, \"Gosh, what was that person's name. \nThat nice gentleman I spoke to the other day?\" When no \nanswer is forthcoming, the entire thing is shrugged off with \nan, \"Oh, well,\" and that's that! \nThis is how people find themselves talking to others, and \naddressing them as, Buddy, Old Pal, Fella', Sweetheart, \nHoney—anything you can think of to keep from finding it \nnecessary to use the person's name, while you squirm with \nembarrassment because you don't know the name. Oliver \nHerford put it this way, when he gave his definition of the \nword, \"darling\": \"The popular form of address in speaking \nto a person of the opposite sex whose name you cannot \nat the moment recall.\" \nHere, then, is your first rule for remembering names:— \nBe Sure You Hear The Name In The First Place! As I said \nbefore, you see the face, so the odds are you will recognize \nit when you see it again. You can only hear the name, so \nget it right. I have yet to hear anyone complain, \"I know \nyour name, but I can't seem to remember your face.\" It is \nalways the name that creates the problem. So, to repeat, Be \nSure You Hear The Name! \nDon't let the fellow that's doing the introducing get \naway with double-talk. If you haven't heard the name, if \nyou're not absolutely sure of it, ask him to repeat it. Some- \ntimes, even after hearing a name, you may not be sure of the \npronunciation; if that's the case, ask the person to spell it \nfor you. Or, try to spell it yourself; he'll correct you if you \nspell it incorrectly, and, he'll be flattered by your interest \nin his name. \n126 Names and Faces  \nIncidentally, if you make a habit of trying to spell the \nname of every new person you meet, you'll soon become \naccustomed to the spelling of most any kind of name. \nYou'll be surprised as to how many of them you'll spell \ncorrectly. Eventually, you will be able to recognize how cer- \ntain sounds are spelled for certain nationalities. You'll learn \nthat the Italian language has no letter, \"],\" so the j sound \nin an Italian name is always spelled with a \"g.\" The } or the \nsoft G sound, and sometimes, the \"sh\" sound in a Polish \nname is usually spelled, \"cz,\" while the sound, \"eye,\" is \nsometimes spelled with the letters, \"aj.\" The ch or tz sound \nin an Italian name is sometimes spelled with a double \"c\"; \nthe sh sound in a German name, particularly at the begin- \nning of the name, is usually spelled, \"sch,\" etc. Of course, \nit doesn't always work—I recently came across a name that \nsounded like, \"Burke,\" but was spelled, \"Bourque.\" How- \never, many of the people who have seen my performance, \nwill vouch for the fact that I spell their names correctly \nalmost 85% of the time. Or, closely enough to impress \nthem, anyway. So, you see, it can be done. I mention this \nbecause spelling a person's name correctly or almost cor- \nrectly, will impress them almost as much as remembering it. \nIf after making sure of the spelling, you realize that the \nname is the same or similar to that of a friend or relative \nof yours, mention that fact. This all serves to impress the \nname on your mind. If it is an odd name, one that you have \nnever heard before, say so. Don't feel shy, or as if you're \nimposing when you do these things, because everybody is \nflattered when you make a fuss over their names. Just as \nthey would be if you showed an interest in any of their \nprized possessions, or in any of their particular interests. \nThis, I suppose, can be put down to human nature. \nWhile talking to the person, repeat his name as often \nas you can in the course of the conversation. Don't keep \nNames and Faces  127 \njabbering it like an idiot, of course, just use it whenever \nyou feel it is apropos and necessary. I am not mentioning \nthis to be facetious. I've read some \"memory experts'\" \ninstructions on this point, and they have given sample con- \nversations:—\"Why, yes, Mr. Greenpepper, I do sail to \nEurope every season, Mr. Greenpepper. And, oh, Mr. \nGreenpepper, don't you just adore Rome, Mr. Green- \npepper? Mr. Greenpepper, tell me this—etc. etc.,\" and so \non into the night. This will not impress Mr. Greenpepper, \nit will scare him out of his wits. \nNo. Just use it, as I said, wherever and whenever you \nfeel it fits. Do use the name when you say good-bye or \ngood night. Don't just say something about hoping to meet \nagain, say, \"Good-bye, Mr. Johnson, I hope we'll meet \nagain soon, etc.\" All this will etch the name more firmly \nand definitely into your mind. \nThe only effort involved, here as usual, is just in doing \nthis the first few times. After that it will become habit and \nyou won't even realize that you are doing it. Make up your \nmind to follow the hints suggested in the last few para- \ngraphs. Read them over, if you feel you're not sure of them. \nFor some people, all this in itself comprises a system for \nremembering names. It is simply because by following the \nabove hints and suggestions you make names interesting, \nyou act interested, and in so doing you actually create \ninterest. And, interest, as I've explained, is a large part of \nmemory. \nAll the above will help your memory for names and faces \nby 25% to 50%, if you apply yourself; but keep reading, \nand I'll help you take care of the remaining 50% to 75%! \nWhat's in a Name?  \nThis fellow was very proud of the way he could remember \nnames by association, until he met Mrs. Hummock. Mrs. Hum- \nmock was quite heavy, and had a large stomach, so he decided \nto use \"stomach\" as his association. \nThree weeks later, he met the same lady, glanced at her \nstomach, and, feeling very pleased with himself, said, \"Good \nday, Mrs. Kelly!\" \nnot too long ago I had the pleasure of performing for the \nexecutive club of a well known department store in New \nYork City. This was their annual dinner, and everyone was \nseated at tables in banquet style. The one demonstration \nin my performance that probably hits home for more people \nthan any other, is the one in which I remember everyone's \nname. \nThe way I usually do it is to introduce myself to all the \nguests as they arrive, or, meet them while they're having \ndinner. I simply walk from table to table getting everyone's \nname (and getting hungry). I'll meet all the people at one \ntable, then the next, and the next, and so on, until I've \nmet everyone in the room. I work as quickly or as slowly as \ntime suggests. Many's the time that I've had to meet one \nhundred to two hundred people in fifteen minutes or less, \n128 \nWhat's in a Name?  129 \nwithout forgetting a single name! I give credit and praise to \nmy methods and systems, of course, not to myself. \nAfter I've met everyone, and after coffee and dessert, the \nshow goes on. During the performance, I ask everyone who \nhas given me their name at any time during the evening \nto please rise at their seats. This most often consists of the \nentire audience. I then proceed to call the names of every- \none standing; pointing to each particular person as I call his \nor her name. During the remainder of my lecture-demon- \nstration, 1 allow anyone in the audience to interrupt me \nby shouting, \"What's my name?,\" and, of course, I imme- \ndiately comply with the person's name. \nThe reason I am explaining all this is because I was \namused at the explanation given by one of the department \nstore executives, revealing how I did the \"trick\" of remem- \nbering everyone's name at this particular affair. This, by \nthe way, was not his idea of a joke, he was firmly convinced \nthat this was how it was done. \nThe affair was held at the Capitol Hotel in New York \nCity. The room we were in, happened to have had a circular \nbalcony completely surrounding it. Following is the explana- \ntion given by the executive. He said: \nMr, Lorayne has a photographer working with him. You \nknow, one of those fellows who takes pictures at banquets \nand develops them in a few minutes so he can sell them \nto the people there and then. This photographer and Mr. \nLorayne both have tiny microphones and receiving sets hid- \nden somewhere on their persons. The photographer is some- \nwhere on the balcony, hidden, of course. There must be a \nhole up there, through which he can put the lens of his \ncamera. Now, when everyone is seated, ready for dinner, \nhe snaps a picture of the entire audience, which he develops \nand dries immediately. \nWhen Mr. Lorayne approaches a table and asks for the \n130 What's in a Name?  \nnames, the photographer hears them too, thanks to the tiny \nmicrophones and receivers. He, the photographer, that is, \nhas the picture in front of him; he spots the table that is \ngiving the names, (he can see through the hole) spots the \nparticular person and listens to the name. He then writes \nthat name on the picture, across the face of the person who \ngave it! He does this with every person in the room. \nNow, you see how simple (author's note: simple??) it \nis? When Mr. Lorayne is performing, he alway points to \naperson before he calls his or her name. The reason for the \npointing is so that the photographer can spot that person \non the picture, read the name, and quickly whisper it into \nhis microphone. Of course, Mr. Lorayne hears it and calls \nthe person by name. \nThat's it. That was this gentleman's explanation of my \nmethod. (Say, maybe it's not such a bad idea at that!) Of \ncourse, he completely discarded all the other demonstra- \ntions that I did during my performance. He also forgot that \nmany of the people change places after dinner, (most of the \ntime I will meet the people in one room, and do the show \nin another) and that after the show, I spoke to the people \naway from the tables, in the elevator, and even in the street, \nand called them by name. Perhaps he didn't forget; he may \nhave thought that the photographer was still whispering \nthe names into his little microphone. If that were the case, \nthe photographer had a trained memory. \nIrelate this incident only to show how difficult it is for \nsome people to believe that you actually can remember the \nnames and faces of an entire audience. They simply take the \npath of least resistance and the negative attitude, and feel \nthat if they can't do it, no one else can; it's just impossible. \nAfter reading my methods on how to remember names \nand faces, I'm sure you will agree with me that it is not \nimpossible. On the contrary, it is much, much easier than \nWhat's in a Name?  131 \nthe method so emphatically believed by the department \nstore executive. \nIwould have been happy to send a copy of this book to \nthis particular gentleman, to prove it to him, too, only I \ndon't know his name; you see, I forgot where I put that \npicture! \nIn previous chapters I've mentioned how important it is \nto be interested in a person in order to remember his or her \nname. If you were to be introduced to four hundred people \nin one evening, and then perhaps meet these four hundred \npeople two or three more times, you would still forget most \nof their names. If, however, you were to enter a room in \nwhich there were four hundred celebrities, such as movie \nstars; you'd probably be able to call them all by their full \nnames. Not only that, but you could tell them at least one \nof the movies in which you have seen them perform. You'll \nagree, I'm sure, that this is because people are interested \nin celebrities and usually want to remember them. Well, \nI've already stressed the fact that being interested in and \nwanting to remember, is half your battle won over a sup- \nposedly poor memory. Remember to use the rules that I \ngave you in the last chapter. \nBe sure you hear the person's name in the first place. \nSpell it or have him spell it if you're not sure of it. \nIf there is any odd fact about the name, or if it is similar \nto a name you know, mention it. \nRepeat the name as often as you can during the course \nof the conversation. \nUse the name when you say good night or good-bye. \nIf you use these rules in conjunction with what I am \nabout to teach you, you should never again forget a name \nor a face. To simplify the process, you will learn first, what \nto do with the name, and then, how to associate the name \nto the face. Actually they go hand in hand; the name will \n132 What's in a Name?  \nconjure up the face, and the face will bring the name to \nmind. \nAll names can be separated into two categories; names \nthat mean something, and names that have no meaning (to \nyou) at all. Names like Cook, Brown, Coyne, Carpenter, \nBerlin, Storm, Shivers, Fox, Baker, King, Gold, Goodman, \nGlazer, and many others, all have a meaning. Names like \nKrakauer, Conti, Sullivan, Mooney, Littman, Carson, Link- \nfeld, Smolensky, Morano, Morgan, Resnick, Hecht, and so \non, have no meaning at all to most of you. Of course, the \nlists are almost endless; these are just a few examples of \neach. \nThere are some names that fall into the \"no meaning\" \ncategory, that do, however, suggest or create a picture in \nyour mind. When you hear the name, Sullivan, you might \nthink of, or picture, a rubber heel, since a very popular \nbrand name of a rubber heel is O'Sullivan. You might pic- \nture or think of John L. Sullivan, the champion fighter. The \nname, Lincoln would, of course, create or suggest a picture \nof our sixteenth president, Abraham Lincoln. Mr. Jordan \nmight suggest a picture of the River Jordan, while the \nname Di Maggio would make you think of baseball. So, we \narrive at three categories of names; those that actually have \nameaning; those that have no meaning in themselves, but \ndo suggest something to you, and finally, names that have \nno meaning and do not suggest or create a picture in your \nmind. \nIt is with the third category that you must use your \nimagination. You must, in order to remember the name, \nmake it mean something to you. This is already so with the \nfirst two categories, so they are no particular problem. The \nnames that have no meaning at all should present no prob- \nlem either, if you have read the chapter on how to remem- \nWhat's in a Name?  133 \nber foreign language vocabulary. If you've read this chapter \ncarefully, you know that you must utilize my system of \n\"substitute words or thoughts\" in order to make the names \nmean something to you. No matter how strange the name \nsounds upon first hearing it, it can always be broken down \nto a substitute word or thought. Simply think of a word \nor phrase that sounds as much like the name as possible. If \nyou were to meet a Mr. Freedman, you might picture a man \nbeing fried. Fried man—Freedman. If the name were Free- \nman, you could picture a man holding or waving an Ameri- \ncan flag; he's free. You might want to picture a man escap- \ning from prison; he's a free man. Remember please, that \nwhatever you decide on for your substitute word, phrase \nor thought, is the one to use. Ten people given the same \nname to remember, may all use a different substitute word \nin order to remember it. \nThe name Fishter might make you picture a fish stirring \nsomething, or stirring something with a fish. Fish stir— \nFishter. Someone else may feel that picturing just a fish \nwould be enough to recall the name. If you want to picture \nsomeone tearing a fish in half, or a fish tearing something \nin half, that would do it too. Fish tear—Fishter. You could \npicture yourself fishing and catching a toe instead of a fish. \nFish toe—Fishter. Any one of these would suffice to help \nyou remember the name. \nIt is not important to strain yourself to find a substitute \nword that sounds exactly like the name; or to use words \nfor every part of the name. Remember what I told you \nsome chapters ago; If you remember the main, the inci- \ndentals will fall into place by true memory! The very fact \nthat you are thinking of and with the name, in this fashion, \nwill help impress it on your mind. You have automatically \nbecome interested in the name merely by searching for a \n134 What's in a Name? \nsubstitute word for it. That's why the anecdote that heads \nthis chapter may be good for a laugh, but can't happen in \nactual practice. \nRecently I had to remember the name, Olczewsky, pro- \nnounced ol-chew-sky. I simply pictured an old man (I always \npicture a man with a long, flowing white beard to represent \nan old man) chewing vigorously, while he skied; old-chew- \nski—Olczewsky. The name Conti might suggest soap, \n(Conti Castile), or you might picture someone counting \ntea bags. Count tea—Conti. For the name Czarsty, you \ncould picture a Russian Czar with a sty on his eye; the name \nEttinger might suggest someone eating, or someone who \nhas \"et\" and injured himself, perhaps hurt a tooth, etc. Et \ninjure—Ettinger. \nIt doesn't matter how silly you get; more often than not, \nthe sillier the better. I've often said that if I could explain \non stage, the silly associations that I've made to remember \nnames, among other things, I'd have a very funny routine. \nAname like D'Amico, pronounced Dam-ee-ko, is not too \nunusual a name. I've come across it a few times, and I've \nremembered it by picturing a woman seeing a dam over- \nflow and screaming, \"Eek\" and \"Oh.\" Or, picturing myself \ngoing towards an overflowing dam (the overflowing gets \naction into the picture) and saying, \"me go.\" Dam eek oh, \ndam me go—D'Amico. This all sounds quite ridiculous. \nGood! The more ridiculous, the easier to tie the picture \nonto the face, as I will explain in a moment, and the easier \nto remember and retain the name. \nAfter meeting a lot of new people, and using my systems, \nyou will find that you'll have certain pictures or thoughts \nfor names that you come across very often. I, for example, \nalways picture an ice cream cone for the name Cohen or \nCohn. I see a blacksmith's hammer for Smith or Schmidt. \nYes, I use the same picture for Smith and Schmidt; true \nWhat's in a Name?  135 \nmemory tells me the difference. You can prove this to your- \nself only through your own experience. Here are some other \n\"standards\" that I employ:— \nThe name Davis always makes me think of the Davis \nCup in Tennis. So when I meet a Mr. Davis, I always pic- \nture a large loving cup. If the name were Davison, I would \npicture the large loving cup and a tiny one next to it; the \nlarge cup's son. Sure, it's silly, but it works! Of course, the \nname Davis may bring an entirely different picture to your \nmind. If it does, use it. For the names ending with either \n\"itz\" or \"witz,\" you can picture itch or brains (wits). i.e.— \nMr. Horowitz—you might picture yourself being horrified \nat the sight of brains. Horror wits—Horowitz. \nMany names end in either \"ly\" or \"ton.\" A lea is a \nmeadow, so I always get a meadow into my association to \nhelp me recall \"ly.\" \"Ton,\" of course, has a meaning. You \nmight picture a weight, a barbell or a dumbbell to always \nrepresent \"ton.\" There are many names that either end or \nbegin with \"berg\"; for these, I always use iceberg. The suf- \nfix or prefix \"stein\" always makes me picture a beer mug \nor stein. I come across the suffix, \"ler,\" quite often, as in \nthe name, Brimler. \"Ler\" sounds like law to me, and I \nalways picture a judge's gavel to represent law. You might \ndecide to picture a policeman or a jail or handcuffs to \nrepresent law; that's okay, just use the same picture for the \nending \"ler\" each time. Eventually you will fall into a pat- \ntern with most endings or entire names. This will make it \neasier and will cut down on time if you have to meet and \nremember people quickly. \nThe knowledge of a foreign language will sometimes \nhelp in creating a picture or association. The name Baum, \nmeans \"tree\" in German. The name, Berg, means \"moun- \ntain.\" If you know this, you can use it in creating your \nsubstitute words or thoughts. Just recently I met a Mr. \n136 What's in a Name? \nZauber. When I remarked that it was an odd name, he told \nme that in German, Zauber meant \"magician.\" I had \nalready pictured myself sawing a bear. Saw bear—Zauber. \nEither that, or \"magician,\" would have helped me remem- \nber Mr. Zauber. \nIhave a very close friend whose last name is Williams. \nHis hobby happens to be playing Billiards, at which he is \nexceptionally proficient. I have fallen into the habit of pic- \nturing someone shooting or playing billiards whenever I \nmeet a Mr. Williams. This works just as well as actually \nbreaking down the name to yams (sweet potatoes) writing \ntheir wills. Will yams—Williams. The first time I met a \nMr. Wilson, the first thought that came into my mind was \nthe slogan for a whiskey, \"Wilson, that's all.\" Now, when- \never I meet a Mr. Wilson, I picture a bottle of whiskey to \nhelp me remember his name. \nSo, as I pointed out, you will eventually fall into certain \nhabits and use certain standards with particular names. \nJust keep in mind that there isn't a name that can't be made \nto mean something (to you) which will sound like the name \nitself and help in bringing it to mind, when necessary. \nAlthough your best method of practice is to go ahead and \nuse the system, here are some names which ordinarily are \ncompletely abstract; have no meaning at all. Why not see \nif you can create a substitute word, phrase or thought for \neach one. \n \nSteinwurtzel \nBrady \nArcaro \nMoreida \nKolodny \nPlatingcr \nHulnick  McCarthy \nGordon \nBriskin \nCasselwitz \nHayduk \nKolcyski \nPukczyva  \n \nWhat's in a Name?  137 \nIf you had any trouble with any of the above names, \nhere's the way I might have created substitute thoughts for \nthem. \nSteinwurtzel—a beer stein worth selling. Stein worth sell \n—Steinwurtzel. \nMcCarthy—I always picture the famous ventriloquial \ndummy, Charlie McCarthy for this name. \nBrady—You could picture a little girl's braids for this. If \nyou want to get the entire name in your picture, see yourself \nbraiding the lines of a large letter, \"E.\" Braid E—Brady. \nGordon—I always picture \"garden\" for this name. \nArcaro—I usually see the famous jockey of the same \nname. If you want to break the name down, see yourself \ncarrying an \"O.\" I carry O—Arcaro. \nBriskin—You might want to picture someone briskly \nrubbing their skin. Brisk skin—Briskin. \nMoreida—You could see yourself reading and calling for \nmore and more books to read. Some of you may have \nthought of your mother (Maw) being a reader. More \nreader or Maw reader—Moreida. \nCasselwitz—A castle completely stocked with brains \n(wits). You might see the brains actually oozing from all \nthe windows. Castle wits—Casselwitz. \nKolodny—I would picture a large knee being all different \ncolors. Colored knee—Kolodny. \nHayduk—Ducks eating hay, or a hayloft or haystack full \nof ducks. \nPlatinger—Picturing a plate with a bandage would suf- \nfice. Plate injure—Platinger. \nKolcyski—Either a piece of coal skiing in a sifting posi- \ntion, or calling your friend Sid to ski would do it. Or, it is \ntoo cold to stand up and ski, so you sit and ski. Coal sit ski, \ncall Sid ski, cold sit ski—Kolcyski. \nHulnick—You might see a little child being very happy \nbecause she has a whole nickel. A picture of a ship whose \nhull is made up of nickel or nickels, would also do it. If \nyou saw yourself nicking a hole in something, you would \nstill recall the name. Whole nickel, hull nickel, hole nick— \nHulnick. \nPukczyva—This name is pronounced puck-shiv-va. I \nwould see a hockey puck shivering with cold. Puck shiver— \nPukczyva. \nThere you are. If you thought of entirely different pic- \ntures, don't worry about it. The point is, that no matter \nhow strange a name sounds, or how long it is, or how diffi' \ncult to pronounce—you can always find a substitute word \nor thought for it. If the substitute word brings the name \nback to you, then that's the one to use, and in the next \nchapter, I'll show you how to use them. \n138 What's in a Name?\nMore about Names and Faces  \nRuth was a sweet and lovely girl and had many boy friends, \nbut her mother felt it was time she was married. \nWhile reading a book on the meanings of names, Ruth said, \n\"Mother, it says here that Philip means 'lover of horses,' and \nJames means 'beloved.' I wonder what George means?\" \n\"I hope, my dear,\" said Mother, \"that George means busi- \nness!\" \nNow that you know how to make any name have meaning, \nby using a substitute word or thought, you have to know \nhow to associate the name to the face in such a way as to \nremember both of them. Many memory systems teach the \nstudent to make a jinglet with the name; something like, \n\"Mr. Baker is a faker\" or \"Mr. Gold is old,\" or \"Mr. Rad- \ncliffe had a mad tiff,\" or \"Mr. Lillienkamp is a carnival \ntramp.\" \nThis is fine, until you meet a Mr. Nepomosimo or a \nMr. Smolensky. Even if you could create a rhyme with those \nnames, what I never could quite grasp is how this would \nhelp you to remember the person's face, or rather, how one \nwould bring the other to mind. No, I don't think that this \njinglet system is of too great a help. In my opinion, the \nonly way to remember a person's name is to associate that \n139 \n140 More about Names and Faces \nname to the person's face in some ridiculous way. And \nhere's how to go about it:— \nWhenever you meet someone new, look at his face and \ntry to find one outstanding feature. This could be any- \nthing; small eyes, large eyes, thick lips, thin lips, high fore- \nhead, low forehead, lines or creases on the forehead, long \nnose, broad nose, wide nostrils, narrow nostrils, large ears, \nsmall ears, ears that stand away from the head, dimples, \nclefts, warts, mustache, lines on the face, large chin, reced- \ning chin, type of hairline, jutting chin, small mouth, large \nmouth, teeth—just about anything. \nYou are to pick the one thing that seems most outstand- \ning to you. It may not be the most outstanding feature; \nsomeone else may choose something entirely different. This \nisn't important; the thing that stands out to you is the thing \nthat will be obvious and outstanding when you meet this \nperson again. The point that is important is that as you're \nlooking for this one outstanding feature, you must pay \nattention to and be interested in the face as a whole. \nYou're observing and etching this face into your memory. \nWhen you have decided on the outstanding feature, you \nare ready to associate the name to that particular part of the \nface. For example, Mr. Sachs has a very high forehead. You \nmight \"see\" millions of sacks falling from his forehead, or \nsee his forehead as a sack instead of a forehead. You can \nsee, of course, that you're to use the same laws and princi- \nples as you've been taught in the early chapters of the book. \nThe most important principle being that you must actually \nsee this picture in your mind's eye. Look at Mr. Sachs' face, \nand \"see\" those sacks falling from every part of his fore- \nhead. That's all there is to it! If Mr. Robrum had a large \nnose, I would picture his nose as a bottle of rum and a \nrobber stealing it! \nMr. Horwick might have very bushy eyebrows,  so I \nMore about Names and Faces  141 \nwould see wicks in them, as in candles, and see a woman \ntrying to take them because they are her wicks. Her wick— \nHorwick. \nThe publisher of this book is Mr. Frederick Fell. The \nmoment I met Mr. Fell, I noticed a cleft in his chin. I \nsimply saw things falling from this cleft, and that's all I \nneeded to help me remember that his name was Mr. Fell. \nRemember that in these examples, I give the substitute \nthought and the outstanding feature that I personally think \nis best. The name, \"Fell\" could have meant \"feel,\" or the \nmaterial, \"felt\" to you, and you could have associated that \nto any other feature on Mr. Fell's face. The substitute word \nand the outstanding feature chosen is an individual thing; \nthe things you choose are the right ones to use. \nAt first, some people may feel that it takes too long to \nfind a substitute word for a person's name, and then asso- \nciate it to his face. They think that it would be embarrassing \nto have people notice that they are staring at them. Please \nbelieve me, it does not take any time at all. After a mini- \nmum of practice, you'll find that you've found a substitute \nword for the name (if it's necessary) and associated it to \nan outstanding feature on the person's face in less time than \nit takes to say, \"Hello.\" As in everything else, it's the very \nfirst effort that is the most difficult. Sure, it's easier to be \nlazy and just go on forgetting names, but, try my system \nand you'll soon agree that it is just as easy to remember \nthem. \nThe best way to practice remembering names and faces \nis to just start doing it. However, to give you a bit of confi- \ndence, let's try this:—I'm sure that before you started \nreading this book, most of you felt that you definitely \ncouldn't remember and retain the names of fifteen people \nif you met them all at once. If you took the little test in \nChapter #3, you probably proved it. Well, let me intro- \n142 More about Names and Faces  \nduce you to the pictures of fifteen people right now, just \nto prove that you can do it, with the help of my systems. Of \ncourse, it isn't as easy with pictures, since you see the faces \nin only one dimension, whereas ordinarily you see people \nin three dimensions. It may be a little difficult to find out- \nstanding features of a face in a picture, but I'll try to help \nyou with each one. \nNo. 1 is Mr. Carpenter. This name is no problem because \nit already has meaning. The next step is to find an out- \nstanding feature on Mr. Carpenter's face. You might decide \non his very small mouth. If you look closely, you'll see a \nsort of scar on his right cheek. Pick one of these (the one \nthat's most obvious to you) and associate Carpenter to that. \nYou might see a carpenter working on the small mouth (get \nthe carpenter's tools into the picture) trying to make it \nlarger; or, have the carpenter working on the scar, trying to \nrepair it. Now, and most important, look at the picture \nof Mr. Carpenter and actually see this picture, see your \nassociation in your mind's eye for at least a split second. \nYou must make yourself \"see\" this picture or you'll forget \nthe name. Have you done that? If so, go to picture #2. \nNo. 2 is the Mr. Brimler we spoke about awhile ago. \nNotice the long dimples in his cheeks. Can you see the \nheavy character lines from his nose to the corners of his \nmouth? As in every face, there are many outstanding fea- \ntures that can be used. I would use the dimples, and see \n\nMore about Names and Faces  143 \n\n144 More about Names and Faces \nthem brim full of judges' gavels. Remember, I use a gavel \nto represent law or \"ler.\" If you want to use policeman, \njail or handcuffs, go ahead. You might \"see\" police brim- \nming all over the dimples. Whichever way you want to do \nit, is fine; but look at Mr. Brimler and see the picture \nyou've decided on. \nNo. 3 is Miss Standish. I would select her \"bang\" hairdo. \nYou could \"see\" people standing on the bangs and scratch- \ning themselves violently because they itch. Stand itch— \nStandish. Of course, a dish standing, would serve the same \npurpose, but I like an association into which I can inject \nsome sort of action. Now look at Miss Standish and see \nthe picture you've decided on, in your mind's eye. \nNo. 4 is Mr. Smolensky. Don't let the name scare you, \nit's easy to find a substitute thought for it. I would see \nsomeone skiing on Mr. Smolensky's very broad nose, and \ntaking pictures (while skiing) with a small camera (lens). \nSmall lens ski—Smolensky. See how simple it is? I have \nchosen Mr. Smolensky's broad nose; you might think that \nthe receding chin is more obvious. Choose whichever you \nthink is most obvious, and see the picture of the skier taking \npictures with a small lens. \nNo. 5 is Mr. Hecht. I would see his mustache being \nhacked from his face with an axe. See the association vio- \nlently if you can. Violence and action make it easier to \nrecall. Hacked—Hecht. Be sure you see the picture. \nNo. 6 is Mrs. Bjornsen, pronounced, Byorn-son. The way \nIwould remember Mrs. Bjornsen is to see a boy (son) being \nborn in the very wide part in her hair. You might think \nthat either her full cheeks or wide mouth, or dark eyes are \nmore outstanding, if so, use those in your association. But \nlook at Mrs. Bjornsen and actually see the picture for a \nfraction of a second. \nMore about Names and Faces  145 \nNo. 7 is Miss Van Nuys. The first thing that I notice \nwhen I look at Miss Van Nuys are her bulging eyes. I \nwould see moving vans driving out of Miss Van Nuys' eyes, \nand making terribly loud noises. So loud that you have to \nhold your ears. (Get the action in the association.) Van \nnoise—Van Nuys. Be sure you see the picture! \nNo. 8 is Mr. Hamper. Notice the very wide mouth. I \nwould see myself throwing all my dirty clothes into his \nmouth because it's a hamper. Remember to look at Mr. \nHamper and see the picture in your mind's eye. \nNo. 9 is Miss Smith. This is a common name, but don't \nthink you'll remember it if you do not make an association. \nThe names, Smith, Jones and Cohen are forgotten just \nas often as the longer and less common names, and there's \nless excuse for doing so. Miss Smith has very full lips, they \nalmost appear to be swollen. I would see a blacksmith \nusing a gigantic smith's hammer on Miss Smith's lips. The \nblows of the hammer are causing the lips to swell. You \n146 More about Names and Faces  \nmight want to utilize Miss Smith's long eyebrows, it doesn't \nmatter. What does matter is that you look at Miss Smith \nand see that picture or association. \nNo. 10 is Mr. Kannen. Pick an outstanding feature. You \nmight notice the ear standing out from the head, or the \nlines in the corner of the eye, or the thin long mouth. You \ncan see a cannon shooting off the outstanding feature, or \ncannons shooting from the feature. Pick the association \nyou like, and see it in your mind's eye. \nNo. 11 is Mr. D'Amico. You can't miss the full head of \nwavy hair. See the hair as a dam, and it is overflowing while \nyou scream, \"eek\" and \"oh.\" Or, you are running towards \nthe dam, shouting, \"me go.\" Look at Mr. D'Amico, and see \nthe picture. \nNo. 12 is Miss Forrester. I would see trees (forest) grow- \ning out of those heavy, definite lines on her lower cheeks. \nIf you want to be sure of the entire name, see the forest \ngrowing wild and tearing her cheeks. Forest tear—For- \nrester. Be sure you see the picture. \nNo. 13 is Mr. Pfeffer; the \"p\" is silent. The first thing \nthat hits my eye is the cleft in Mr. Pfeffer's chin. I would \nsee lots of black pepper pouring out of this cleft. So much, \nin fact, that it's making me sneeze. \"Pepper\" would be \nenough to tell me that this is Mr. Pfeffer. If you want to \nmake sure, hear yourself sneezing like so: \"fffft,\" with an \n\"f\" sound. Silly? Yes; but this will come back to you later, \nand you'll know that the name is Pfeffer, not Pepper. See \nthe picture. \nNo. 14 is Mr. Silverberg. See a large silver iceberg instead \nof Mr. Silverberg's jutting chin. Actually see it glittering, so \nyou get the idea of silver in there. If you want to use the \nlaugh lines around the corners of Mr. Silverberg's mouth, \nthat's okay, too. See a silver iceberg on each side. Which- \never feature you use, be sure to actually see the picture. \nMore about Names and Faces  147 \nNo. 15 is Miss Kornfeld. I would see millions (exag- \ngeration) of ears of corn falling from Miss Kornfeld's wide \nmouth. Make sure that you look at Miss Kornfeld, and \nactually see the picture or association in your mind's eye. \nIhave purposely used a wide assortment of names to \nprove that it just doesn't make any difference as to the \ntype of name. You might want to go over these faces once, \nquickly, to make sure you've made a strong enough asso- \nciation. Now, here are the same faces in a different order, \nwithout their names. See if you can't fill in the fifteen spaces \nunder the pictures. When you've done so, check yourself \nand be amazed at the improvement in your memory for \nnames and faces! \nIf you had any trouble at all recalling any of the names, \nthe reason is that you didn't make your association vivid \nenough; you didn't actually see the association in your \nmind's eye. If you did miss any, just look at the face again, \nstrengthen your association and try it again. You'll surely \nremember them all on your second try. If you feel confident, \nwhy not try that test in Chapter #3, and compare your \nscore now, with the score you originally made. Tomorrow, \nor the day after, look at the fifteen faces pictured in this \nchapter, and in Chapter #3, and you'll see that you still \nknow the names of all the people! \nKeep in mind that if you can remember the names of \nfaces in pictures, you'll find it much easier to do when \nactually meeting people. Aside from finding an outstanding \nfeature more easily, there are many other things that can \nbe taken into consideration, such as: manner of speech, \nspeech defects, character, type of walk, manner of bearing, \nand so on. \nIf you happened to be at an affair, and wanted to showoff \nby memorizing the names of everyone present, you could \ndo it now, by using the systems you've just learned. You \n148 More about Names and Faces  \n\nwould probably find it helpful to review the names every \nso often. Each time you look at a person, his name should \nspring to mind. The name coming to mind in this fashion \nserves as a review, and serves to etch the name more firmly \ninto your memory. If you were to spot someone you've met, \nand the name didn't come to mind, ask for the name again, \nor ask someone else to give it to you. Then strengthen your \noriginal association. Try it! You'll amaze yourself and your \nfriends. \nFor practical purposes—for those of you who meet peo- \nple, and would like to retain the names; writing the names \nwould help, as far as review is concerned. As I said in the \npreceding chapters, writing in conjunction with a system of \nassociation is fine. This is a good example of that fact. You \nwould, of course, use the systems learned here, upon meet- \ning these people. Then at the end of the day, think of each \nnew person you've met and as the name comes to mind, \njot it down. The next day go over this list of names. As you \nlook at each one, a picture of the person's face will come \nto mind. Just picture the person for a moment, and see \nyour original association of the name to face. That's all. Do \nthe same thing a few days later; then again, a week later, \nand so on until the faces and names are indelibly etched \nin your memory. \nOf course, all this is theoretical, because if you wanted \nto remember these people, it is probably because you intend \nMore about Names and Faces 149\n150 More about Names and Faces \nto meet them again. If you do meet them often and recall \ntheir names, well, then that serves the purpose of review, \nand writing the names isn't necessary at all. \nThe thing to do is to use whatever is best for you or your \nparticular circumstances. Just make up your mind to get \nover the initial hump of actually putting my systems to \nwork, and they will diligently work for you. \nIt Pays to Remember Facts about People  \nIt is the common wonder of all men, how among so many \nmillions of faces there should be none alike. \n—Sir Thomas Browne \nyes, fortunately, there are no two faces exactly alike. If all \nfaces did look alike, we couldn't remember them, or the \nnames, memory system or not. I have been challenged many \ntimes, to remember the first names of a set of identical \ntwins. So far, I have always been able to spot one difference, \nhowever minute, in their faces. It is to this difference that \nIwould associate their names. So, as the French say, \"Vive \nla difference!\" \nIf you have studied the previous chapters on how to \nremember names and faces; and if you have tried the \nmethods, you should be greatly improved by now. Although \nin most cases it is the second, or family names that most \nof us want to remember, some of you may be interested \nin remembering first, or given names as well. This too, can \nbe done with a conscious association. You can use a substi- \ntute word for the first name, and get that into your original \nmental picture; or, you can picture someone you know very \nwell, having the same first name, with the person you wish \nto remember. \n151 \n152 Facts about People  \nSubstitute words for first names are easy to find; Harry \ncould be \"hairy\"; Clark could be \"clock\"; for William, I \nalways picture a man with a bow and arrow as William Tell, \nwhile money or \"rich\" always means Richard, to me. Anne \ncould be \"ant\"; Marion could be \"marrying\"; for Gloria, \nyou might see the American Flag (Old Glory), etc. \nIf you use the substitute word idea for remembering first \nnames, after a while you will have one at your fingertips \nfor any one that you meet. \nThe system of picturing a friend of yours whose first \nname is the same as the person whom you want to remem- \nber, might work just as well for you. If you meet a Mr. \nJohn Sitrous, you could use the substitute word \"citrus\" \nto associate to an outstanding feature; then put your friend, \nJohn, into the picture somehow, (in a ridiculous way) and \nyou'll remember that Mr. Sitrous' first name is John. \nAgain, it is not for me to tell you which idea to use, you \nmay use one or both, as the circumstances demand. This is \nentirely up to you. If you find that you can remember first \nnames with one system better than with the other, then by \nall means, use the one that helps you most. \nIf at first, you have a bit of trouble remembering the first \nnames, don't let it bother you; just use the second name. \nKeep at it for a while and you'll soon be able to remember \nfirst names just as well as you do second names, and vice \nversa. You won't insult anyone by remembering only his or \nher last name. Benjamin Disraeli had an out even if he \nforgot both names; he once said, \"When I meet a man \nwhose name I cannot remember, I give myself two minutes, \nthen if it is a hopeless case, I always say, 'And how is the \nold complaint?'\" Since most of us have some sort of old \ncomplaint or other, Disraeli probably flattered everyone he \nused this on, making them believe that he remembered them \nFacts about People  153 \nquite well. However, no need for subterfuge; use my sys- \ntems and you will remember names and faces. \nMore important, I think, than remembering first names, \nis to be able to remember pertinent facts about the people \nyou meet. This holds true for business and social life. Busi- \nnesswise, particularly, since it is often helpful to remember \nwhat items or style numbers you sold to a certain customer, \nor, if you're a doctor, to remember patients' symptoms and \nailments, etc. It is also very flattering to meet a person \nwhom you haven't seen in some time and have him ask \nabout things that are close to you, but would ordinarily have \nno interest to him. This will not only make people like you \n(people always like you if you show an interest in their \ninterests) but can be quite an asset in business. \nThe method is the same as for remembering first names. \nJust put the thing into your original association when you're \nmemorizing the name and face. If I met a Mr. Beller, whom \nIwanted to impress, and I knew he was an avid stamp col- \nlector—I might associate \"bell\" to an outstanding feature \non his face, and then associate stamps to that bell. \nSome of you may feel that this might confuse you into \nthinking that the man's name is Bellstamp; but again, true \nmemory tells you the difference. You'll know that the name \nis Beller (to make sure, you could use bell-law in the orig- \ninal association) and you'll be able to flatter him by asking, \nor talking, about his stamp collection. \nDuring my own performances, I will usually meet doc- \ntors, judges, commissioners, mayors, and many people with \ntitles other than \"Mister.\" It is essential for me to address \nthem correctly, because even though I remember their \nnames, people with titles may be insulted if I do not use \nthat title, or if I forget it. The same idea applies; I simply \nput something into my original association which will re- \n154 Facts about People \nmind me of the title. Anything will do; the first object that \ncomes to mind when you hear the title is usually best. I \nalways picture a stethoscope to remind me of \"doctor,\" \nbecause that's the first thing with which I associate a doctor. \nOf course, scalpel, hypodermic, operating table, or any- \nthing like that, would suffice. \nWhen I meet a judge, I always put a gavel into my \nmental picture. This is enough to remind me to address \nthis person as \"judge.\" You might like to picture the \njudicial robe; that's just as good. Years ago, I recall seeing \napicture of New York's mayor Jimmy Walker, wearing a \ntop hat. For some reason, this picture has always stuck with \nme. Now, whenever I am introduced to a mayor of a town \nat an affair, I make sure to get a top hat into my association. \nIhave done quite a few performances for servicemen, \nand I have had to prepare a substitute word beforehand to \nremind me as to whether the person was a sergeant, cor- \nporal, lieutenant, captain, major, or what have you. As I \nmet each man, I would put this substitute word into my \nassociation of name to face, and I did address each man \ncorrectly. \nSo you see that any word can be put into your associations \nto remind you of things pertaining to the person, as well \nas his or her name. I have mentioned time and again, the \nfact that you must use these ideas in order for them to \nwork for you. I do this only because it is important enough \nto warrant repetition. If you maintain the attitude that \nnothing can help your terrible memory, then nothing will, \nbecause you won't let it. Take a positive view of it all; try \nthese ideas, and you'll be pleasantly surprised. If you've read \nup to here in this book, and tried all the ideas and systems \nup to now, I'm sure you've already been convinced. \nI've also told you that all these ideas and methods are \nmerely aids to your true memory. If you didn't have the \nFacts about People  155 \ncapacity to remember to begin with, you wouldn't remem- \nber, no matter how many systems you used; nor could you \nremember the systems. If you were to make an extreme \neffort to remember, you would; there's no question about \nthat. The problem is that we're all too lazy to make that \neffort. The systems contained in this book, simply make it \neasier for you to make the effort. In order to make your \nassociations, you must pay attention to the thing you want \nto remember; the rest is easy. \nIt would take far too much time and space for me to \ntell you how helpful my trained memory has been to me, \naside from my public appearances. Of course, people will \nsometimes carry things to an extreme. I meet and remember \napproximately one to three or four thousand people every \nweek, sometimes more. It would be a little silly for me to \ntry to retain all those names and faces. But, I never know \nwhen I'll be stopped on the street, or in a movie, or while \ndriving my car, or in some small town that I may have \nplayed two or three years ago—and have someone demand, \n\"What's my name?\" \nThese people expect me to remember them although I \nmet them with three or four hundred other people, at the \ntime. The amazing part is that in 20% to 30% of the time, \nmy original associations, made, perhaps years ago, will come \nback to me after thinking for a few moments. Then I do \nknow the person's name. In your case, this is no problem \nbecause I'm sure that very few of you have to meet and \nremember anywhere near three or four hundred thousand \npeople a year. \nIthink that this book probably would never have been \npublished if it weren't for the fact that I remembered one \nperson's name. I had spoken to Mr. Fell, the publisher, \nabout the book the first time I met him. He said he would \nthink about it, and that was that. About five months later. \n156 Facts about People  \nafter meeting many thousands of people, I happened to be \nperforming for an all male group at a charity breakfast. A \ngentleman approached me and asked if I remembered him. \nAfter a moment's thought, I realized it was Mr. Fell, who \nhappened to have heard that I was appearing there, and \ncame down to test me. I told him his name; and weeks \nlater he all but confessed that if I hadn't remembered him, \nhe wouldn't have been half as enthused about the book as \nhe was now. You see, he naturally wanted to be sure that \nmy systems really worked. \nThis is only one instance where remembering one per- \nson's name was important to me. Remembering the right \nperson's name at the proper time, may perhaps mean a \ngreat deal to you, sometime in the future. It might be the \nstepping stone to a better job, a bigger opportunity or a \nmuch better sales contract, etc. So, try these systems, use \nthem, and I believe you'll be well paid for your efforts. \nIt Pays to Remember Telephone Numbers  \nThe little girl was trying to get the telephone operator to find \natelephone number for her. \noperator: You can find that number in your telephone di- \nrectory. \nlittle girl: Oh, I can't, I'm standing on it! \nalthough most of you do not have to stand on the tele- \nphone directory in order to use the phone, you do have to \nuse it quite often to look up numbers that you've forgotten. \nSure, many people feel that it isn't necessary to remember \nphone numbers since that's just what the directory is for; \nbut the fact remains that the phone companies have to keep \ninformation operators on duty continually. Next to forget- \nting names and faces, I think the most common memory \ncomplaint is, \"I simply can't remember telephone num- \nbers!\" As I mentioned in an earlier chapter, most untrained \nmemories are one-sided. Those who usually do remember \ntelephone numbers, can't remember names, and vice versa. \nOf course, I intend for you to be able to do both, and more, \nwith equal proficiency. \nMy good friend Richard Himber, famous musician- \nmagician, realized that most people couldn't remember \nphone numbers, so he did something about it. He made it \nvery simple for everyone to remember his—he just told \n157 \n158 Telephone Numbers \nthem to dial his name, R. Himber. Somehow, he managed \nto obtain an exchange for his telephone that begins with \nthe letters, RH. The rest of the number is 4-6237, which \nyou get when you dial i-m-b-e-r. Now, don't you all dial \nit just to see if this is true—take my word for it, it is! \nThis, of course, solved everybody's problem when it came \nto remembering Mr. Himber's telephone number (if they \nremembered his name) but unfortunately, we can't all have \nnumbers like this. No, you'll just have to learn to remember \nphone numbers, and the telephone operators will love you \nfor it. \nTelephone numbers in New York and most major cities \nconsist of an exchange name, an exchange number, and four \ntrunk line numbers. i.e.—Columbus 5-6695. By making a \nridiculous association of two or three words or items, you \ncan memorize any telephone number; and by adding one \nthought to your association, you can remember to whom \nthe phone number belongs. \nMost telephones in use today are dial phones, so all \nthat is necessary to remember is the first two letters of the \nexchange name; since that is all we have to dial. These two \nletters are all we will consider. Now then, the first thing \nyou have to learn, is to form one word which will imme- \ndiately help you recall both the first two letters of the \nexchange name and the exchange number. The word, of \ncourse, should be one that can be pictured easily. The num- \nber CO 5-6695 can serve as an example. How can we find \none word to represent CO 5? Simple! The word must begin \nwith the letters, \"co,\" and the very next consonant sound \nin the word must be the sound that represents the exchange \nnumber according to our phonetic alphabet. In this case, \nit is the \"1\" sound, representing #5. \nAny word that can be pictured will do, no matter which \nsounds follow the \"1\" sound; because those will be disre- \nTelephone Numbers  159 \ngarded. The only things that matter in the word you choose \nare the first two letters and the next consonant sound. For \nexample, the word, \"column\" would represent CO 5; the \n\"mn\" at the end of the word is disregarded. The words, \ncollar, colt, color, cold or coliseum would also fit the system. \nIf you can think of a word that can be pictured, that has no \nother letters after the consonant that represents the ex- \nchange number—use it. The word, \"coal\" is an example \nthat fits this case. \nKeep in mind that you don't have to use a word that has \nonly the first two letters and the exchange number sound. \nThe first word that comes to you is usually, although not \nalways, the one to use. If the number you wish to memo- \nrize begins BEachview 8, you could use the word, \"BEef\" \n(BE 8). Here are a few more examples to make sure that \nyou get the idea:— \nREgent 2 — rent—Reynard (The Fox) \nESplanade 7 — escape — escalator \nGRamercy 8 — grave — graph \nDElaware 9 — deep — deputy \nGOrdon 5 — sold — goal \nCLover 3 — clam — climb \nI've given only two words for each exchange, but there \nare many others that would fit. \nDo you see how simple it is? There's no reason why you \nshouldn't be able to find a word, immediately, to represent \nany exchange and exchange number. Let me remind you \nthat the word you select has to have a meaning for you \nonly. Probably, if I gave ten people an exchange and ex- \nchange number, they would each use a different word to \nhelp remember it. Although nouns are usually best, that \ndoesn't mean that you have to use a noun. Some of you \nmay find that a foreign word you know, is just right for a \ncertain exchange and exchange number; if so, use it; it \n160 Telephone Numbers \ndoesn't matter. What does matter is that it recalls the \nexchange for you. I could give you a list of all the exchange \nnames used in New York City and the exchange numbers \nused with these names, and also give you a word that would \nrepresent each of them. I could do that, but I won't. I \ndon't believe it would help you any. It's much better if you \nmake up the words as soon as you find it necessary to do \nso, instead of memorizing a long list of them. \nAt the risk of being repetitious, I must say, again, that \nthe picture created in your mind is something that I cannot \nhelp you with. One word may create an entirely different \npicture in your mind, than it would in mine. Actually, some- \ntimes it is not even a word that I use; but a thought. I \npurposely used one in the above examples. For REgent 2, \nIgave \"Reynard\" as a word to help remember it. Now, \nReynard creates a definite picture in my mind because \nReynard the Fox was a favorite character of mine when I \nwas a child. If you never read those wonderful stories, then \nReynard would mean nothing to you. If I had used Rey- \nnard in my association, I would simply picture a fox. True \nmemory would tell me that the telephone number began \nRE 2, and not FO 7 (fox). I'm telling you all this just to \nshow you that even if you can't think of a word to fit a \nparticular exchange name and number, you can always find \nsomething, even a nonsense phrase or word, to recall it for \nyou later on. The same thing holds true, not only for phone \nnumbers, but for anything that makes it necessary for you \nto make up a word for an association. \nAll right, now to go on with the rest of the telephone \nnumber. If you understand the idea of how to make up a \nword for the exchange name and number; the rest is easy. \nAll you have to worry about now are the four trunk line \nnumbers. Well, any four digit number can be broken into \ntwo of your peg words. If you simply associate the two, \nTelephone Numbers 161 \nyou'll remember the four digits. For the number 4298, you \nwould associate rain (42) to puff (98); for 6317—chum \n(63) to tack (17); for 1935—tub to mule, and so on. You \nnow have all the ingredients for remembering phone num- \nbers, all that remains is to mix them. Let's use CO 5-6695 \nas an example. To remember this number simply associate \ncoal (CO 5) to choo choo (66) to bell (95)! For the \nnumber AL 1-8734, you could use—altar to fog to mower; \nand for OX 2-4626—oxen to roach to notch. \nNow, before showing you how to remember whose phone \nnumber you're remembering, let me point out that there \nis one fly in the ointment, so to speak, involved here. Were \nyou to make a ridiculous picture in your mind of say, steam, \nrope and tomb, you would know that the exchange was \nST 3 (steam) and that the trunk line numbers were 4913 \n(rope, tomb). But, would you remember whether it was \n4913 or 1349? Therein lies the problem! You might be con- \nfused a week or so after memorizing a phone number, as to \nwhich peg word was first and which was last. Of course, if \nyou use a telephone number that you memorize, then this \nis really a theoretical problem. Once you've used it a few \ntimes, you'll know which pair of digits comes first. As I've \nsaid many times before, the systems are wonderful aids to \nyour true memory. Without the use of the system for \nremembering phone numbers, you probably wouldn't know \nany of the digits in the number. \nHowever, for numbers that you do not intend to use \nright away, there are many methods of avoiding this con- \nfusion, some good and some, not so good. I'll give you three \nor four ways right now, and you can pick the one or two \nthat you think is best. \nThe first idea is to make a link of the words, instead of \none complete ridiculous picture. For example, for ST 3-4913 \nyou could make one picture of a radiator (steam) lassoing \n162 Telephone Numbers  \n(rope) a tomb; whereas if you made a link you would asso- \nciate steam to rope, and then rope to tomb. Since the link \nsystem makes you remember in sequence, you would know \nthat you've memorized the number in its correct order. \nAnother idea, and one I use quite often, is to simply make \none complete ridiculous picture, but to make the ridiculous \npicture itself in a logical sequence. Let me explain that for \nyou. Actually I've done it in the example I just gave you. \nThe picture of a radiator lassoing a tomb is quite ridiculous, \nbut it is a good example of a logical sequence in an illogical \npicture. Having made the association in this way, you \ncouldn't possibly think of tomb being first, or lasso (rope) \nbeing second—the words (which, of course, are transposed \nback to numbers when you want to dial the phone number) \nare pictured in the correct order to begin with. Let me give \nyou another example of this, so you'll know just what I'm \ntalking about. For the phone number DE 5-3196—the \nwords, deal, mat and beach would suffice in aiding your \nmemory. If you pictured yourself dealing mats on a beach \n(getting sand all over the mats and yourself) you've got \nalogical illogical association. The word mat definitely comes \nbefore the word beach, so you know that the number is \n3196 and not 9631. \nThe above idea is the one I use most often, followed by \nthis one:— I always try to find a word to fit more than two \nof the four digits of the trunk line numbers. For example— \nST 3-4913—I might picture a radiator ripping the hem of a \ngirl's dress. Steam—ripped—hem. Or, steam—repaid—me, \netc. And, there will be some numbers wherein you can find \naword to fit all four of the trunk line digits. \nIbelieve that most of you will want to use one or more \nof these three methods. However, to give you a wider \nchoice, here are one or two other ways of avoiding the pos- \nsibility of mixing your numbers. You can always use your \nTelephone Numbers  163 \npeg word for the first two digits of the four; and any word \nthat is not a peg word, but does fit phonetically, for the \nsecond pair of digits. i.e.—the trunk line number to be \nmemorized is 6491—use cherry for 64, but don't use bat \nin your association for 91—use any other word for 91, like \nbeet, or boat. Now, after any length of time, when you want \nto remember this particular number, you would know that \n64 is first because cherry is a peg word; beet or boat are not \npeg words, therefore 91 is the second pair of digits! For the \nnumber In 1-4084, you might associate indian—rose—fairy. \nFairy is not a peg word, so 84 must be the last or second two \ndigits. \nIdevised this last method quite recently and I find that \nit works like a charm. Its use definitely dismisses the possi- \nbility of exchanging the numbers. There are other thoughts \non the subject, of course, such as picturing one of your \nitems much larger than the other, etc., but I don't hold too \nmuch stock in them. \nIhave taken all this space to explain these ideas because \nthe same thoughts hold true for remembering prices, ad- \ndresses, time schedules, style numbers and anything that \nrequires that you memorize four digit numbers. As far as \ntelephone numbers are concerned—the worst that could \nhappen if you exchanged the digits in the trunk line num- \nbers, is that you would dial the wrong number the first time, \nbut get your party the second time. \nBy the way, if a zero should be the first of the two digits, \nsimply make up a word for the digits. For 05, use sail, cell \nor sale; for 07—sick, sock or sack, etc. If you run across two \nzeros in a row, you could use seas, sews or zoos. \nWell, now you should know how to memorize any tele- \nphone number! In order to remember whose phone num- \nber it is, it is necessary to add only one word to your associa- \ntion. If the number belongs to someone with whom you \n164 Telephone Numbers \ndeal, say, the tailor, butcher, grocer, doctor, or anyone that \ncan be pictured, just put that person into your association. \nFor example, the tailor's phone number is FA 4-8862. Just \nmake an association of tailor—farm—fife—chain. If you're \nusing my suggestion of not using a peg word for the last \ntwo digits, you could use chin instead of chain. You might \npicture the tailor (a man sewing) growing fifes on his farm, \nwhich he plays with his chin. If you like the link idea, sim- \nply link the four items. \nSince a tailor, doctor, dentist, etc. can be pictured, all \nyou have to do is get that picture into your association. If \nyou want to remember names in conjunction with phone \nnumbers, you must use the substitute word system as you \nlearned in Chapter 16. Mr. Hayes' telephone number is \nOR 7-6573—you might picture a bale of hay (Hayes) play- \ning an organ (Or 7) in jail (65) while it combs (73) its \nhair. If you are using the link idea—link hay to organ, organ \nto jail, jail to comb. If you like my last suggestion on how to \n\nTelephone Numbers  165 \navoid mixing the trunk line numbers; change comb to \ncoma, game or comma, etc. \nLet's say that you wanted to remember that Mr. Silver- \nberg's phone number was JU 6-9950. You might \"see\" a \npicture of a shiny silver iceberg sitting in a courtroom as \njudge (JU 6) smoking a gigantic pipe that's covered with \nlace! This is a logical illogical sequence in one ridiculous \npicture. I'll use this same number to show how you would \nhandle it using any of the methods for keeping the trunk \nline numbers straight. \nLink method—associate ice-berg to judge, (the ice-berg \nis pounding his gavel) then judge to pipe, (\"see\" a gigantic \npipe as a judge) and then pipe to lace, (picture yourself \nsmoking a pipe filled with lace, or see a pipe making lace). \nIf you want to use less items in your association for this \nparticular phone number, you could picture the ice-berg as \najudge with a lot of pupils (9950)! \nTo use the last method, simply change lace, to any other \nword that would represent 50; like lass, lose, lies or lasso. \nIhave given you examples of memorizing phone numbers \nusing the different ideas, because I feel that it is up to you \nto use the method that comes easiest to you. As with any- \nthing else in this book, I can only give you theoretical ex- \namples, your imagination must do the rest for you, and only \nyou can decide which of certain methods are best for you. \nIdoubt if you would ever find it necessary to memorize a \nphone number that you didn't intend to use for any great \nlength of time. The fact that you want to remember it \nmeans that you intend to use it. And, as I mentioned be- \nfore, the association will recall it for you the first few times \nyou have to dial it—after that you can forget your original \nassociation, or stop trying to remember it, anyway, because \nthe phone number will probably be permanently etched in \nyour memory. \n166 Telephone Numbers  \nAs usual, the explanation takes much longer than the \ndeed itself. It is but the work of a few moments to memo- \nrize a telephone number. Unless you are using it as a mem- \nory stunt, and want to do it quickly, you would ordinarily \nhave plenty of time to find the proper words and make your \nassociations. The fact that you must think of the number \nin order to find these words and make the association helps \nto set it into your mind in the first place. If all I accomplish \nwith this book, is to make you think of, or concentrate on, \nanything you wish to remember—then I will feel that I've \naccomplished quite a bit, because you will certainly have \nimproved your memory. \nYou can check your improved memory for phone num- \nbers right now by trying test #6 in Chapter #3 again, and \ncomparing the scores. \nThe Importance of Memory  \nAbusiness man traveling in the mid-west was told about an \nIndian, living in the vicinity, who had a most fantastic memory. \nHaving just completed a memory course, and priding himself on \nhis own newly acquired achievements, he decided to visit this \nIndian to see whose memory was better. \nHe introduced himself to the Indian and proceeded to test \nhim. The memory expert answered every question quickly and \naccurately. His mind was a storehouse of knowledge, containing \nsuch information as the populations of nearly all American \ncities, important dates, scientific theories, etc. The business man \ncouldn't stump him. Finally, he decided to try one last question. \n\"What did you have for breakfast on the morning of April 5th, \n1931?\" \nThe Indian didn't hesitate for even a second, as he answered, \n\"eggs!\" \nThe business man took his leave, completely stunned by this \nprodigious memory. When he arrived home, he told all his \nfriends about it, only to have them scoff and say that eggs \nwere usually eaten at breakfast, and that anyone could have \nanswered that. \nAs the years passed, the man began to believe this, until one \nday he found himself back in the mid-west on a sales trip. \nOne afternoon he happened to come upon the same Indian he \nhad met here years ago. Wanting to show that his memory for \nfaces was pretty good, he raised his hand in the traditional \nIndian greeting, and said, \"How.\" \nThe Indian thought for just a moment, and then answered, \n\"SCRAMBLED!\" \n167 \n168 The Importance of Memory  \nalthough the above anecdote is pretty silly, since no one \nwould ask anyone to recall what they had for breakfast years \nago—you'd be surprised at the questions some people ask \nme. If I had a conversation with a person some time ago, \nthey'd ask me to repeat the conversation exactly; or, if I'm \nspied reading a newspaper, someone is sure to grab it from \nme and insist that I prove that I've memorized it word for \nword. They don't realize that the beauty of having a trained \nand systematic memory, is that I can remember what I \nwant to remember. \nIt would be kind of ridiculous for me to memorize the \ndaily paper word for word. There is no need for that; how- \never, I can and do remember anything that I come across \nthat I feel is important enough to memorize. I just make an \nassociation for it as I read it. When I read a story or novel, \nIam usually reading for enjoyment only, and I'm not at \nall interested in remembering what I'm reading. There are \nsome things that we all want to forget; for example, it is \ndiplomatic to remember a woman's birthday but not her \nage. \nAfter completing this book, I hope that all of you will be \nable to remember anything you read, that is, if you want to. \nAs I've mentioned before, you can remember anything if \nyou so desire. These memory systems just make it easier for \nyou. Perhaps, some of you do not, as yet, agree with that. \nYou may feel that it is much easier to write down a tele- \nphone number than to stop and make an association as I've \nexplained. Well, I must admit that it probably would be \nfaster and easier, at first; but you wouldn't be helping your \nmemory. \nYou might feel that since there are millions of reference \nbooks to use whenever you need certain information, why \nbother to remember. And, of course, most business men \nhave secretaries to remember for them. \nThe Importance of Memory  169 \nYes, it's true that business men have secretaries, but they \nprobably wouldn't be in the position to hire one if they \ndidn't have good memories for their businesses in the first \nplace. And, how long do you think the secretary would keep \nthe job if she couldn't remember? \nAlthough there are millions of reference books, and we \ncertainly need them—a lawyer pleading a case in court \nwould much rather have the details of a precedent in his \nmemory, than have to stop to look it up. If he could quote \npages and laws from certain law books, the judge and \njury would most certainly be favorably impressed. A car- \npenter doesn't stop to look at a book when he has to use a \nparticular tool; he remembers how to use it. If an emer- \ngency arises on the operating table, the surgeon acts im- \nmediately. All the medical books in existence wouldn't help \nthat patient, if the doctor didn't remember just what to do. \nWhen you visit your doctor and tell him the symptoms \nof your illness, he doesn't have to refer to the notes he wrote \nwhile attending medical school—he remembers which ail- \nment has which symptoms. \nThose that write new ideas on old subjects, must know or \nremember all the old ideas first. Could a man like Professor \nEinstein come up with new formulas and theories if he \ndidn't know or remember all the current ones? Of course \nnot. The telephone would never have been invented if \nAlexander Graham Bell had not known or remembered all \nthe principles of transporting sound that were then in exist- \nence. If it were not for memory, we would never have new \ninventions. \nIcould go on, ad infinitum, demonstrating how and why \nthe memory is important; or why it is not always convenient \nto refer to books or lists. Most everything we do is based on \nmemory. The things we often say we do by \"instinct,\" are \nreally done through memory. \n170 The Importance of Memory  \nWriting things down just isn't enough in itself to help \nyou remember. Why are some children slow in school, even \nthough they write notes in class? It is not because they are \nstupid! It is because they don't remember their work. In \nschool they are told they must remember certain things, but \nunfortunately, they are not taught how to do so. \nSo, a trained and retentive memory is certainly impor- \ntant. \nIt is getting over the first hurdle that is always the most \ndifficult in any new thing you learn. The first hurdle in \ntraining your memory, is to actually use my system. Use \nit, and it'll work for you. Just knowing the system and still \nwriting phone numbers on paper, is the same as not know- \ning the system at all. \nThose of you who happen to know how to type fairly \nrapidly—do you recall how you felt when you first started \nto learn typing? You thought you'd never get the hang of \nit, and felt that others, who did type well, were just more \nsuited for it than you were. Now, you probably can't under- \nstand why you felt that way; there is nothing more natural \nthan for you to sit down and type rapidly. Well, it's the \nsame with a trained memory. I believe that I can memorize \natelephone number faster than anyone can write it, and, I \nstrengthen my memory each time I do so. When I first \nstarted using these systems, I felt as you may feel now; that \nit is easier to write things down and forget them, than to \nbother with associations. But, keep at it, and you'll feel \nthe same about this as you do about typing. You'll wonder, \nafter a while, why it took any effort at all, in the beginning. \nThe thing to keep in mind, above all else, is to make all \nyour associations ridiculous and/or illogical. Many of the \nsystems being taught today, and those in the past, do not \nstress this nearly enough. As a matter of fact, some of them \nwill teach you to make logical associations. There's only one \nThe Importance of Memory  171 \nfault with such systems, as far as I'm concerned—they \nwon't work. I do not believe that you can remember logical \nassociations anywhere as well, or as easily, as ridiculous ones. \nSome of the old systems taught the student to correlate \ntwo objects when he wanted to remember one in conjunc- \ntion with the other. A correlation meant to link the two \nobjects by means of other words which either sounded alike, \nmeant the same, were the exact opposites or were brought \nto mind somehow or other. This happens to be an excel- \nlent imagination exercise, so let me explain it to you. If you \nwanted to remember \"pencil\" and light \"bulb\" for some \nreason; you might reason this way:— \npencil—lead—heavy—light—bulb. \nDo you see the process? Pencil would naturally make you \nthink of lead; the mineral lead is very heavy; the opposite of \nheavy is light; and light logically leads you to bulb. \nHow would you correlate \"diamond\" to \"cigarette\"? \nWell, here's one way: diamond—ring—smoke ring—smoke \n—cigarette. Actually, you can correlate any two objects to \neach other; even the most unlikely things. Of course, it's \nmuch easier to remember \"pencil\" and \"bulb\" by making \nan association of yourself writing with a light bulb instead \nof a pencil; or, throwing a switch, and a pencil lights instead \nof a bulb. As far as \"diamond\" and \"cigarette\" is concerned, \nif you \"saw\" yourself smoking a diamond instead of a ciga- \nrette, you'd certainly recall it with more facility than by \nmaking a correlation. I mention the correlations only be- \ncause it is a good imagination exercise, and because you \nmight have some fun trying it with your friends. The idea, \nof course, is to use as few words as possible in order to corre- \nlate any two items. \nCorrelations are a fairly current idea for memory training, \nbut as I've already told you, memory systems go back as far \nas early Greek civilization. I believe it was Simonides, the \n172 The Importance of Memory  \nGreek poet, who first used something like the Peg system \nin the year 500 b.c. He used the different rooms of his \nhouse, and the pieces of furniture in the various rooms, as \nhis pegs. This is limited, but it will work. If you would \nmake up your mind to use the rooms of your house and the \nfurniture in a definite order, you would have a list of peg \nwords. These would be the things you already know or \nremember, and any new thing to be memorized would be \nassociated to them. \nThis must have worked for Simonides, because one of \nthe stories about him, tells of the time he was giving a reci- \ntation at a banquet, and the roof of the building collapsed. \nEveryone was killed, except Simonides. Because of the \nmangled condition of the bodies, they could not be identi- \nfied for burial. Simonides was able to tell just who each one \nwas; for he had memorized their positions around the ban- \nquet table. \nComing back to modern times—General George Mar- \nshall received some favorable publicity because of some- \nthing he did at some of his press conferences. He told the \nnewsmen to interrupt him and ask him any questions, at \nany time during his talk. The reporters would do that, ask- \ning questions pertaining to the topic that the General was \ndiscussing at that moment. General Marshall would listen \nto the question, but would not answer it. He wouldn't break \nhis train of thought, but went right on with his talk. After \nthe talk was completed, he would look at one of the men \nwho had asked a question, and answer that particular one. \nHe would then look at another man, and answer his ques- \ntion. He did this until all or most of the questions were \nanswered. This was alwavs of great amazement to the news- \nmen; but it is quite easy with the aid of a memory system. \nFormer Postmaster James Farley has a reputation of \nknowing some twenty thousand people by their first names. \nThe Importance of Memory  173 \nIn a recent article for the N. Y. Times, Mr. Farley called \nremembering names the \"most effective of all forms of \nflattery.\" His marvelous memory for names has certainly \nbeen a great help to him. It is even said that Mr. Farley's \ncampaigning and calling people by name was influential to- \nwards the late Franklin Roosevelt's first election to the \npresidency. \nIdon't expect you all to be influential in the election of \npresidents, but you can certainly improve your memory \nbeyond your wildest hopes, if you will learn and use the sys- \ntems taught in this book. \nDon't Be Absent-minded  \nTowards the conclusion of his lecture on the wonderful sights \nto be seen in this world, the famous traveler said, \"There are \nsome spectacles that one never forgets!\" \nAt this point a tiny old lady in the back row, stood up and \ntimidly inquired, \"Oh, my, can you tell me where I could get \napair? I'm always forgetting mine!\" \nare you continually plagued by misplacing certain items? \nDo you waste precious time searching for your glasses or for \nthe pencil which is usually perched behind your ear? Are \nyou the type that's always screaming, \"But I just had it in \nmy hands a moment ago!\"? Do you always hide your valu- \nable trinkets so well, that you yourself can't find them? \nLadies; are you constantly late for a date because you sim- \nply can't locate your favorite lipstick? And, men; does your \nwife rant and scream while you laboriously search for that \nmisplaced cuff link? \nIf the answer to any of these questions is, \"Yes,\" run, \ndon't walk, to your nearest bookstore ------------- . \nWell, if this were a radio or television commercial, it \nmight sound something like that, don't you think? But \nseriously, have I hit the bull's eye with some of the above \nquestions? I'm almost certain that I have, because very few \n174 \nDon't Be Absent-minded  175 \nof us are fortunate enough not to be absent-minded at \ntimes. \nMany people make the mistake of confusing absent- \nmindedness with a poor memory. Actually, I feel that they \nshould be considered as two entirely different things. People \nwith excellent memories can also be absent-minded. You've \nall heard of the absent-minded professor stories; well, be \nassured that in order to be a professor you must have a good \nmemory to begin with. The hundreds of gags about the \nabsent-minded professors who wind their wives, kiss the \ncat good night and put out the clock, may be true for all I \nknow, but it still doesn't signify that they have poor mem- \nories. \nIbelieve that you can cure absentmindedness with just a \nlittle effort and with the tips contained in this chapter. \nHowever, please do not feel that you can do it by just read- \ning it. You have to make it your business to use the infor- \nmation supplied here. Then, and only then, will it help \nyou. I assume that many people will read through a book \nof this type; never try to use the information given, and \nthen complain that this will never help them. That, of \ncourse, will be true, if you just read through this book with- \nout attempting to apply the systems. Many adults always \nclaim that they are too old to learn. I believe they mean \nthat they are too lazy to learn—no one is too old! E. L. \nThorndike, an authority on adult education, said that \"age \nis no handicap to learning a new trade, profession, or any- \nthing you want to do at any time of life.\" The italics in this \nquote are mine; if you really want to learn, you can; so don't \nuse age as an excuse. \nActually, absentmindedncss is nothing more than inat- \ntention. If you paid attention to where you put your glasses, \nnaturally you would know where they were when you \nneeded them. The American College Dictionary gives \"pre- \n176 Don't Be Absent-minded  \noccupied\" as one of the definitions of absent-minded, and \nthat just about hits the nail on the head. The little things \nthat we do continually, like putting down things, are just \nnot important enough to occupy our minds—so, we become \nabsent-minded. \nIt stands to reason that if you put things away without \nthinking, or mechanically, you'll forget where they are, \nbecause you never remembered in the first place. When you \nleave your house, you usually worry about whether you \nlocked your door or not, simply because you locked it un- \nconsciously, without giving it a thought. \nSo, I've solved your problem! To avoid absentmindedness, \nthink what you're doing. I know, you're thinking, \"I knew \nthat. If I were able to think each time I put something \naway, or locked a door, I wouldn't be absent-minded!\" \nOkay, then, why not use conscious associations to help you \nremember trivial things? You can, you know, and it's easy \nto do. \nFor example, one thing that is annoying to all of us, is \nforgetting to mail letters. You either forget to take them \nwhen you leave your house, or, if you do take them, they \nremain in your pocket for days. If you want to be sure that \nyou take the letter with you when you leave the house, do \nthis:— First decide what it is that you do or see at the very \nlast moment upon leaving your house. I personally see the \ndoorknob of my front door, because I check it to see if the \ndoor is locked. That is the last thing I do, so I make a ridicu- \nlous association between doorknob and letter. When I leave \nmy house the next morning, I'll check the doorknob; once \nIthink of doorknob, I'll recall my ridiculous association \nand remember that I must take the letter! \nThe last thing that you do before you leave your house, \nmay be entirely different; you may kiss your wife or husband \ngood-by—well, associate that kiss with the letter. Make sure \nthat your associations are ridiculous and/or illogical. \nNow, how can you be sure to mail the letter? One way is \nto keep it in your hand until you drop it in a mail box. If \nyou'd rather keep it in your pocket, make an association \nbetween the person the letter is going to, and the mail box. \nYou might \"see\" him sitting on top of a mail box, etc. If \nyou do not know the person well enough to picture, use a \nsubstitute word as you’ve already learned. If the letter were \ngoing to the telephone company, you would associate tele- \nphone to mail box, and so on. When you see a mail box, in \nthe street, it will remind you to mail the letter. (After all \nthat, I hope you remembered to put a stamp on the enve- \nlope! ) \nThis idea can be used for all the little things you want \nto remember to do. If you keep forgetting your umbrella at \nthe office, just associate umbrella to the last thing you do \nDon't Be Absent -minded 177\n178 Don't Be Absent-minded  \nupon leaving the office. If your wife calls and tells you to be \nsure to buy some eggs on your way home—associate eggs \nwith, say, your front door. This will act as a final reminder. \nInstead of waiting to be reminded when you're home, asso- \nciate eggs to grocery store; then when you see a grocery \nstore, it will remind you to go in and buy the eggs. \nOf course, all these are theoretical examples: you would \nknow just what to associate to what, in your own particular \ncase. \nNow we come to the real petty annoyances of absent- \nmindedness; such as putting things down, and then forget- \nting where they are. Well, the method applied to this is \nexactly the same. You have to make an association between \nthe object and its location. For instance, if the phone rings, \nand as you reach for it, you put your pencil behind your \near—make a fast mental picture between ear and pencil. \nWhen you're through with the phone, and you think of \npencil, you will know it's behind your ear. The same thing \ngoes for any small item or small errand. If you're in the \nhabit of putting things down anyplace, get into the habit \nof making an association to remind you of where it is. \nOne of the questions usually asked at this point is:— \n\"Fine, but how am I going to remember to make these as- \nsociations for all these petty things?\" There is only one an- \nswer to this question—use some will power at first, and \nbe sure that you do make the associations. When you see \nthe results, I'm sure you'll manage to keep it up, and before \nyou know it, you will have acquired the habit. \nThere is no doubt, by the way, that this system must cure \nabsentmindedness. The reason is obvious; the eyes cannot \nsee if the mind is absent—and your mind is absent when \nyou put things away mechanically. The very idea of making \nan association makes you think of what you're doing for at \nleast a fraction of a second, and that's all that's necessary. \nDon't Be Absent-minded  179 \nIf you make an association between your key and your door, \nas you lock the door—you are no longer doing it mechan- \nically. You are thinking of it; therefore, later on when you \nwonder if you locked the door, you'll know you did. When \nsetting the alarm on your clock, make an association be- \ntween clock and hand, or between clock and anything, for \nthat matter. It doesn't matter; the important thing is that \nyou're thinking of it for the moment. And, because you \ndid think of it for the moment, you won't have to get out \nof bed later to check if the alarm is set. \nIsay that the association doesn't matter, and it doesn't. \nAs a matter of fact, if you closed your eyes and saw yourself \nturning off your iron as you were doing it, you wouldn't \nhave to worry about whether it was on or off, while trying \nto enjoy a movie. Closing the eyes and picturing the action, \nis just as good as the association. It serves the same purpose; \nthat of forcing you to think of what you're doing at the \nmoment. \nThat's all there is to it. But I can't stress strongly enough \nthe necessity of using what you've just learned. Please don't \nread it, nod your head and say it's a great idea, and then \nforget about it. Put out the bit of effort necessary at first, \nand you will be glad you did. \nCaptain of ship talking to sailor: \"Don't you ever say 'the back \nof the ship' again—that's the stern of the ship; and that's port- \nside, that's starboard, that's the crow's nest, that's the gig, that's \nthe forecastle, etc. \n\"If you ever say 'back of the ship' again, I'll throw you out of \nthat—that, er, that little round hole over there!\" \nJust as absentmindedness is often mistaken for a poor \nmemory; so is absentmindedness often blamed for mental \nblocks. Again, I don't think that one has anything to do \nwith the other. Having something familiar on the tip of \nyour tongue and not being able to remember it, is not ab- \n180 Don't Be Absent-minded \nsentmindedness. What it is and why it happens, I don't \nknow; but, unfortunately it does happen; to me as well as \nto you. \nThere isn't much I can do to help avoid mental blocks. \nThere isn't any system I know of that can stop them. How- \never, I can tell you that when it does happen—try to think \nof events associated with the name or event you're trying to \nrecall. If it's the name of a familiar person that you can't \nthink of, try to picture the last time you saw that person, \nwhere it was, what you were doing and who else was present \nat the time. \nThe mind must work in its own devious way; more \noften than not, just thinking around the fact you want, will \nmake it pop into your mind. \nIf this doesn't help, the next best thing is to forget about \nit. Stop thinking about it completely for awhile, and the \nodds are it will come to you when you least expect it. \nThat's about all the help I can give you when it comes to \nmental blocks. Try my suggestions the next time it happens \nto you; you may be surprised at how helpful they are! \nAmaze Your Friends  \nfarmer (showing off his farm to a friend): \"How many sheep \nwould you say were in that flock? See if you can get close with \narough guess.\" \nfriend (after short pause): \"I'd say there were about 497 \nsheep there.\" \n\"Why, yon hit it right on the head, that's exactly right! \nHow in the world did you know?\" \n\"It was simple, really, I just counted all the legs, and then \ndivided by four!\" \nthe memory stunt contained in this chapter may not be as \nastounding as dividing the legs of sheep by four, but it's \ncertainly easier to do. You'll probably be glad to know that \nthere are no mathematics involved at all—just a trained \nmemory. \nAfriend of mine in the textile business here in New York \nhas told me that he has gained quite a reputation for him- \nself by remembering numbers. He goes to lunch with a few \nbusiness acquaintances each day, and he invariably asks \nthem to give him any four or five digit number to memo- \nrize. He usually has anywhere from three to six people with \nhim, and he memorizes the numbers they give him. They \ninterrupt him during the luncheon to see if he can still re- \ncall the numbers, and, of course, he does. \n181 \n182 Amaze Your Friends \nIdon't mention this because it's a big deal particularly, \nbut it is a good conversation starter, and it has accom- \nplished a purpose for my friend. He tells me that everyone \nin his trade is talking about him and his remarkable mem- \nory. I do mention it, however, to show you how people are \nimpressed with any sort of memory feat; only because they \nfeel that they could never accomplish it themselves. If folks \nare so amazed when a man remembers a half dozen four or \nfive digit numbers, you can imagine the fantastic effect \nupon them, after you've mastered the stunt contained in \nthese pages. \nHow would you like to be able to memorize this list of \nnumbers: \nThat's right! You can memorize this list of four hun- \ndred digits, easily!! Not only will you know them in order, \nbut also out of sequence! The idea is to give anyone a copy \nof this list, and have them test you on it. They may ask \nyou to give the numbers across for letter G, or the numbers \ndown, for column 4. They can ask for E7, and you will \nimmediately give them the number 6720. In other words, \nyou prove to them that you have thoroughly memorized the \nlist; and so you have! \nMy good friend and memory expert, Bernard Zufall, was \nthe first one that I know of, to use this type of stunt. He has \nAmaze Your Friends  183 \nbeen using it for many years with three digit numbers in- \nstead of the four digit numbers that appear here. He, of \ncourse, utilized his own methods to memorize the list. I \nwill teach you here, the method that I use:—  \nYou must realize by now that it would be almost impos- \nsible to accomplish this without the aid of the phonetic \nalphabet. Certainly, it would be definitely impossible to \nmemorize and retain the numbers without it. As a matter \nof fact, this feat is so unbelievable to the uninitiated, that \nyou will find some people examining the list to find some \nmathematical solution. Let them; since this is not based on \nmathematics at all, they'll be more impressed and confused \nthan ever.  \nNone of the four digit numbers in the list is repeated at \nany time, each one is used only once. The numbers have \nnot been chosen at random, I've picked each one because \nit fits into the system. And, here is the system:— If some- \none were to call E7—here is the way my mind would work. \nMy Key word for E7 must begin with the letter E, and \nit must have one other consonant sound at the end. That \nsound (in this particular case) must be the sound that \nrepresents #7, which is the k or hard g sound. My Key \nword for E7 is \"egg.\" Eggs come from chickens—and the \nphonetic alphabet tells me that \"chickens\" stands for 6720. \nIf you'll check the list, you will see that 6720 is the correct \nnumber!  \nIf B5 were called, I would know that the Key word must \nbegin with the letter B, and the ending consonant sound \nmust be the 1 sound for #5. The Key word for B5 is \"bell.\" \nAbell rings. Rings—4270! Can you see the simplicity of it? \nDon't get me wrong—it will take you a bit of time and \nstudy to master all the numbers, but the system is easy. \nAgain, may I mention that this is not only a fantastic mem- \nory stunt, but a wonderful thinking and memory exercise.  \n184 Amaze Your Friends  \nEach time you master one of the stunts in this book, \nwhether you care to present them or not, you are improving \nyour memory, exercising that muscle and sharpening your \nwits. \nWell then, you know that each time a letter and number \nare called, you must transpose it into a Key word. It doesn't \nmatter if the number is called first, the system is the same. \nThe letter is always at the beginning and the consonant \nsound that represents the number is at the end of the word. \nThis Key word is correlated to, or associated with another \nword; and this word gives you the four digit number, ac- \ncording to the phonetic alphabet. If someone were to call, \n\"8C,\" you would know that the Key word starts with C and \nends with the f or v sound. The Key word is \"cuff.\" Cuff is \ncorrelated to trouser. Trouser—1404! \nThe entire list for the one hundred four digit numbers \nfollows here. After you have looked them over, I'll explain \nsome more about the presentation of the feat. \n \nA1 — ate-burped \nA2 — awn-sunshade \nA3 — aim-rifles \nA4 — air-vents \nA5 — ale-drink \nA6 — ash-cinder \nA7 — ache-limps \nA8 — Ave. -street \nA9 — ape-growls \nA10 — ace-clubs  B1— bat-and ball \nB2 — bean-shooters \nB3 — bum-loafing \nB4 — boar-wild pig \nB5 — bell-rings \nB6 — - badge-breast \nB7 — bag oranges \nB8 — buff-luster \nB9 — baby-dimple \nB10 — bass-fiddles  C1 — cat-felines \nC2 — can-crushed \nC3 — comb-baldhead \nC4 — car-cadillac \nC5 — -coal-burns \nC6 — cash-real money \nC7 — coke-tables \nC8 — cuff-trouser \nC9 — cap-covered \nC10 — case-crates  \nD1 — dot-and dash \nD2 — den-wild lion \nD3 — dam -breaks \nD4 — deer-antler \nD5 — dill-pickles \nD6 — dish-cracked \nD7 — dog-canines \nD8 — dove-white bird  E1 — eddy-whirlpool \nE2 — en-alphabet \nE3 — em-emperor \nE4 — err-is divine \nE5 — eel-slippery \nE6 — edge-border \nE7 — egg-chickens \nE8 — eve-evening  F1 — fat-stomach \nF2 — fun-laughter \nF3 — foam-bubbles \nF4 — fur-bearing \nF5 — foil-tinfoil \nF6 — fish-angler \nF7 — fake-magician \nF8 — five-dollars  \nAmaze Your Friends  185 \n \nD9 — dope-stupid \nD10 — dose-medicine  E9 — ebb-falling \nE10 — ess-curves  F9 — fib-fibbing \nF10 — fuse-blend  \nG1 —gat-pistol \nG2 — gown-material \nG3 — game-football \nG4 — grow-flowers \nG5 — gall-bladder \nG6 — gush-geysers \nG7 — gag-comedian \nG8 — gave-donated \nG9 — gap-opening \nG10 — gas-tanks  H1 — hat-bands \nH2 — hen-crowing \nH3 — ham-sandwich \nH4 — hare-rabbits \nH5 — hill-climbed \nH6 — hash-corned \nH7 — hack-driver \nH8 — have-ownership \nH9 — hop-skipped \nH10  — hose-nylons  I1 —it-article \nI2 — inn-tavern \nI3 — I'm-myself \nI4 — Ira-Gershwin \nI5— isle-Manhattan \nI6 — itch-scratch \nI7 — Ike-Capitol \nI8 — ivy-cling \nI9 — (y)ipe-scream \nI10 — ice-buckets  \nJ1 — jot- write down\nJ2 — John-Barrymore\nJ3 — jam-spread \nJ4 — jar-contain \nJ5 — jail-prison \nJ6 — judge-condemn\nJ7 — jack-lifts \nJ8 — jive-dancer \nJ9 — Jap.-Japanese \nJ10 — juice-rinds  \nYou'll notice that there is only one slight exception in \nthe system, at 19. There is no word beginning with I and \nending with the p or b sound. So I use the word, \"yipe,\" \nwhich serves the purpose just as well. Also, in every possible \ncase, the sounds representing the four digit numbers are \ncontained in one word. There are only eight instances where \nIfound it necessary to use a phrase of two words. \nI'm sure that you all can see the simple associations or \ncorrelations with each Key word. If you go over them once \nor twice, concentrating on them as you do, you should re- \nmember most of them. Each Key word should lead you \nlogically to the associated word. Coke, for C7, is short for \nCoca-Cola, which is usually found on dinner tables. En, for \nE2, is just the name of the letter itself, which is part of the \n186 Amaze Your Friends  \nalphabet. I don't think that any of the others need any ex- \nplaining. \nYou must learn all these words thoroughly before you \ncan present this feat for your friends. After you've learned \nthem, practice the transposing of the associated words or \nphrases into numbers. Once you can do that quickly, you're \nready to present the feat. \nYou can have the list printed on a card, if you like, so \nthat you can hand them out to your friends. Then after \nyou've demonstrated your fabulous powers of retention and \nrecall, you can let them keep the card as a souvenir. Let \nthem try to memorize it, if they can! \nAside from simply allowing your spectators to call the \nletter and number, you can go further. They can ask you \nto call out all the numbers diagonally from, say, A1 to J10. \nAll you have to do, is give the numbers for A1, B2, C3, D4, \netc. They might ask for row F backwards—you just give \nthem F10, F0, F8, etc. If they want the four digit numbers \nbackwards also, you can do that too. For example, you know \nthe associated word for F10 (fuse) is blend—instead of \ngiving the number 9521, give it as 1259! F9 is fibbing— \nbackwards the number is 7298, and so on. \nIf you're asked to give row #6 backwards, simply call off, \nJ6, I6, H6, G6 down, or up, to A6. I know that it is difficult \nfor some people to work backwards with the alphabet. I \ncan solve that problem for you, easily. You can learn the \nrepresentative number of any letter in the alphabet by uti- \nlizing the first twenty-six peg words in conjunction with a \nrepresentative adjective. This is what I mean:— \n \nAwful tie \nBrave Noah \nCute ma \nDamp rye \nExcellent \nlaw Neat tire \nOld towel \nPleasing \ndish \nQuiet tack \nRed dove  \nAmaze Your Friends  187 \nFunny shoe \nGuernsey cow \nHeavy ivy \nIdle bee \nJagged toes \nKorean tot \nLoud tin \nMarble tomb  Solid tub \nTough nose \nUgly net \nVirtuous nun \nWonderful name \nX-rayed Nero \nYellow nail \nZig-zag notch  \nNotice that the adjective for the peg word for #3 begins \nwith the third letter of the alphabet (c); the loth adjective \nbegins with the tenth letter J, etc. If you make a quick pic- \nture in your mind of each of these, you will know the posi- \ntion, numerically, of all the letters! Of course, you can \nuse any adjective you like, as long as it begins with the \nproper letter. If you wanted to know the position, say, of \nthe letter \"o\"—just think of the adjective that you used: \nold towel. You know that \"towel\" is #15, therefore \"o\" is \nthe fifteenth letter of the alphabet. \nYou can use this idea, or, elsewhere in this book (Chapt. \n#12) you will find an idea of how to use the twenty-six \nletters themselves in order to have a list of twenty-six sec- \nondary peg words. You can tie these words to your basic \npeg words, and you will have accomplished the same thing. \nYou will know the numerical positions of all the letters. \nEither one of these methods will enable you to use the \nletters of the alphabet to a much better advantage. Just \nthinking backwards from peg word #26 to peg word #1 \nwill make it easy for you to recite the entire alphabet back- \nwards. This in itself is a good stunt, since most people \ncannot recite the alphabet backwards, without quite a bit \nof effort. However, the important thing is that this idea will \nbe of use when you're asked to give a numbered row back- \nwards^ or diagonally from J10 to A1, or J1 to A10. \nAfter doing this stunt for awhile, you will find that even- \n188 Amaze Your Friends \ntually you will not even think of your Key words and asso- \nciations! As soon as a letter and number is called, the four \ndigit number will pop into your mind. \nThat is the beauty of mnemonics, it is just an aid to your \ntrue memory. It is a means to an end, and once you've \nreached or acquired that end, you can forget the means!! \nIt Pays to Remember Appointments \nand Schedules  \n\"The man who is always punctual in keeping appointments \nnever loses anything by it.\" \n\"No, only about half an hour waiting for the other fellow \nto show up.\" \nthere isn't much I can do about those of you who know \nthat you have an appointment, and get there late, anyway. \nBut I think I can help you if you forget those appointments \ncompletely. You've already learned, in a previous chapter, \nhow to remember your errands or appointments for each \nday. You can still use that idea; but if, in your particular \nbusiness, or even socially, you find it necessary to keep nu- \nmerous appointments during the week at certain times of \nday, you'll be interested in this chapter. The system con- \ntained here is one which enables you to make a conscious \nassociation as soon as you've made an appointment. By \nmaking this association, you can recall all your appoint- \nments for each day of the week without bothering with a \ndate or memo book. \nFor those of you who don't care about remembering \nweekly appointments or schedules, I would suggest that \nyou learn the idea behind the method anyway. You never \nknow when you might find it useful. Please don't let the \n189 \n190 Appointments and Schedules  \nlength of the explanation frighten you; once you under- \nstand and use it, there's nothing to it. \nThe first thing you must do, is to give a number to each \nday of the week. Since there are seven days in the week, \nyou'll number them from 1 to 7. According to our calendar, \nSunday is the first day of the week; but I have found that \nmany people refer to Monday as the first day. This, I imag- \nine, is because of our work-a-day world, and the first day \nof work is Monday. I will therefore use Monday as the first \nday in the following explanation. If you are accustomed to \nconsidering Sunday as the first day of the week, just change \nthe explanation as you read. From now on remember the \ndays of the week in this manner:— \nMonday—1 Thursday—4 \nTuesday—2 Friday—5 \nWednesday—3  Saturday—6 \nSunday—7 \nOnce you know the number of each day of the week, you \ncan transpose any day at any hour to one of your peg words. \nThat's right, you will use the peg words which you already \nknow, to help you remember schedules and appointments. \nEach day at every hour will be represented by a peg word, \nand you don't have to remember anything to know the \nwords; it works itself. \nAny day at any particular hour can be transposed into a \ntwo digit number in this way:— The number of the day will \nbe the first digit, and the hour itself will be the second \ndigit. For example, if you wanted to remember an appoint- \nment for Wednesday at 4:00 o'clock—Wednesday is the \nthird day, so # 3 is the first digit. The appointment is for \n4:00 o'clock, so #4 is the second digit. You now have a two \ndigit number—# 34, and the peg word for # 34 is \"mower.\" \nTherefore, \"mower\" must represent Wednesday at 4:00 \no'clock! \nAppointments and Schedules  191 \nMonday at 2:00 o'clock would be \"tin.\" Monday is the \nfirst day, and the time is 2:00 o'clock. In the same way, you \nwould arrive at the following:— \nThursday at 1:00 o'clock—rod (41) \nFriday at 8:00 o'clock—lava (58) \nSunday at 6:00 o'clock—cage (76) \nTuesday at 9:00 o'clock—knob (29) \nSimple, isn't it? Of course, if you can transpose the day \nand hour to a peg word, it is just as easy to transpose a peg \nword to the day and hour. \"Notch,\" for example, is your \npeg word for #26; so it must represent Tuesday (2) at 6:00 \no'clock. \nThere are two hours that cannot be represented by a peg \nword. That is because they themselves are composed of two \ndigits. I mean, of course, 11:00 and 12:00 o'clock. Ten \no'clock can be transposed to a regular peg word, because it \nis thought of as zero only, instead of one and zero. In other \nwords, Saturday at 10:00 o'clock would be transposed to \n#60 (cheese), because Saturday is the sixth day and 10:00 \no'clock is zero. \"Rose\" (40) would represent Thursday at \n10:00 o'clock; Monday at 10:00 o'clock is \"toes,\" and so on. \nI'll give you two methods for handling eleven and twelve \no'clock, both of which have been tried and tested. The first \nmethod is the obvious one (although not the better one) \nbecause it follows the same system as the other hours. \nTranspose any day at eleven or twelve o'clock to a three \ndigit number by adding the 11 or 12 onto the number of \nthe day. I.E.—Tuesday at 11:00 o'clock—211; Thursday \nat 12:00 o'clock—412; Sunday at 12:00 o'clock—712; \nWednesday at 11:00 o'clock—311, etc. Now, you would \nhave to make up a peg word, following the phonetic alpha- \nbet, which would fit each day at eleven or twelve o'clock. \nThe words you select would be used all the time for those \ndays and hours. If you want to use this idea (don't make \n192 Appointments and Schedules  \nup your mind until you've read the second method) I'll \ngive you some examples of words that can be used. You can \npick any of these, or any that you find by yourself. \nMonday 11:00—dotted, toted \n12:00—tauten, tootin' \nTuesday 11:00—knotted, knitted \n12:00—Indian, noddin' \nWednesday         11:00—mated,   imitate \n12:00—mutton, mitten \nThursday 11:00—raided, radiate \n12:00—rotten, written \nFriday 11:00—lighted, loaded \n12:00—Latin, laden \nSaturday 11:00—cheated, jaded \n12:00—jitney, shut in \nSunday 11:00—coated, cadet \n12:00—kitten, cotton \nThe following method, I think, is the better of the two. \nFirst of all, I transpose the day at 11:00 or 12:00 o'clock \ninto a two digit instead of a three digit number. I do this \nby considering 11:00 o'clock as a one, and 12:00 o'clock as \natwo. Now, Friday at 11:00 o'clock is thought of as 51; \nFriday at 12:00 o'clock—52; Sunday at 11:00 o'clock—71; \nSunday at 12:00 o'clock—72, etc. Of course, you can't use \nyour regular peg words for these, since they are already be- \ning used for one and two o'clock; so use any other word, \nthat fits phonetically, for these numbers. \nLet me give you a few examples:— For Tuesday at 11:00 \no'clock, you could use the word \"nut\"; later on, when you \npicture your association (I'll explain the associations in a \nmoment) you will know that \"nut\" couldn't represent \nTuesday at 1:00 o'clock because you would have used your \nAppointments and Schedules  193 \nregular peg word, \"net\" for that. So, \"nut\" must stand for \nTuesday at 11:00 o'clock. \nSaturday at 12:00 o'clock could be represented by \"chin.\" \nYour regular peg word, \"chain,\" represents Saturday at 2:00 \no'clock, so you know that \"chin\" must mean Saturday at \n12:00. Do you get it, now? Basically, it's this:— For any day \nat eleven or twelve o'clock use the same sounds that you \nwould use for that day at one or two o'clock, but do not \nuse your regular peg word. That's all there is to that! \nIf all your appointments are usually made for the exact \nhour, on the hour, you actually need read no further about \nmemorizing appointments; you have all the information \nyou need right now. Supposing you have an appointment \nto see your dentist at 9:00 o'clock on Tuesday, and you \nwant to be sure that you won't forget it. Well, transpose \nTuesday at 9:00 o'clock, to the peg word, \"knob,\" and asso- \nciate that to dentist. You might picture a gigantic doorknob \nas a dentist, or you could see (and feel) your dentist pulling \naknob from your mouth, instead of a tooth. \nIf you had to remember to make a deposit at your bank \non Monday at 2:00 o'clock—you would associate \"tin\" to \nbank. You have to catch a plane on Friday at 11:00 o'clock \n—associate \"loaded\" or \"lad\" (according to the method \nyou're using for 11:00 and 12:00 o'clock) to airplane. \nWednesday at 10:00 o'clock you have to visit a friend— \nassociate \"mice\" to your friend, etc. \nIf you usually have appointments with people whom you \ndo not know too well, or if you cannot picture them, use a \nsubstitute word for their names in your associations. \nThat's all you have to do. If you have made an association \nfor all your appointments for an entire week, and you want \nto remember what you have scheduled for, say, Tuesday— \nsimply go over the peg words for that particular day:— \nTuesday—nose, net, nun, name, Nero, nail, notch, neck, \n194 Appointments and Schedules  \nknife, knob, knitted or knot, and Indian or neon. As soon as \nyou reach a peg word that has been associated, you'll know \nit! You might reach \"neck,\" and know immediately that \nyou've made a picture of neck, and say, hospital. This will \nremind you that you have to visit a sick friend at the hos- \npital at 7:00 o'clock on Tuesday! That's all! Again, you \nneed only try it to be convinced that it works. \nAs far as I personally am concerned, this is all I use to \nremember my weekly schedule. Some of my appointments \nmay be arranged for the hour exactly, and others for say, \n3:15, 3:30 or 3:45, but I find that it doesn't matter. If I \nassociate the day of the appointment at 3:00 o'clock, on \nthe hour, true memory tells me that the date is for fifteen, \nthirty or forty-five minutes past the hour. However, there \nmay be some of you who must remember the exact time, to \nthe minute, for some appointments, such as catching trains, \netc. In order to do this, you must add only one word to \nyour mental picture. You would actually be remembering \nafour digit instead of a two digit number. \nThe second pair of digits will represent minutes, while \nthe first two digits represent the day and the hour. For \nexample, if your appointment with the dentist was on Tues- \nday at 9:42 o'clock—transpose the day and hour to \"knob\" \n(29), and get \"rain\" into the association to represent 42. \nYou realize, of course, that in this case you are faced with \nthe same problem as you were when learning to memorize \nthe four trunk line digits of a telephone number. \nIn the above example, how will you be sure that your \ndental appointment is for Tuesday at 9:42, and not for \nThursday at 2:29? This could happen if you weren't sure \nas to which peg word belongs first, and which belongs last. \nWell, the problem is solved in the same manner as it was \nsolved for telephone numbers. The best solution is to make \nAppointments and Schedules  195 \na\"logical illogical\" association, so that, even though it is a \nridiculous picture, one peg must logically follow another. \nIf you made a picture of your dentist pulling a \"knob\" \nfrom your mouth, instead of a tooth, and doing it in the \npouring \"rain,\" you would know that knob came first, fol- \nlowed by rain. Any of the other suggestions that I gave you \nfor telephone numbers will apply for appointments, too. If \nyou used the Link for your picture—you would associate \ndentist to knob, and then knob to rain. The idea of using a \nword other than the regular peg word, for the last two digits \n(in this case, the digits representing the minutes) is just as \napplicable here. That would help for any day at any time, \nexcept 11:00 or 12:00 o'clock, where it wouldn't be neces- \nsary, since you are not using a regular peg for the day and \ntime, anyway. \nYou are the best judge as to just which ideas to use. I \nwould suggest trying them all; the one that comes easiest to \nyou, of course, is the right one for you. Although, as I told \n196 Appointments and Schedules \nyou, I don't think it necessary to bother with the minutes \nof an appointment—If I did want to remember the min- \nutes, I would do it this way:— On Monday at 3:25 I must \nremember to pick up a television set—I would picture a \ntelevision set acting as a \"tomb\" stone, while \"nails\" per- \nform on the screen. \nYou see, I use the logical illogical picture idea. The asso- \nciation above will leave no doubt that \"tomb\" (Monday at \n3:00 o'clock) comes first, followed by \"nail\" (25 minutes). \nOne other example:— On Wednesday at 12:10, I have a \ndate to go swimming—I would make a picture of myself \nswimming; I hit a \"mine\" which injures my \"toes.\" Now, \nwhen I go over my pegs for Wednesday of that week: mice, \nmat, moon, mummy, mower, mule, match, mug, movie, \nmap, mitt and mine (I always use \"mitt\" to represent \nWednesday at 11:00, and \"mine\" for Wednesday at 12:00), \nIwill be reminded of this ridiculous picture. I know that \n\"mine\" is not one of my regular pegs, so it must represent \n12:00, not 2:00 o'clock. \"Toes\" (10), being the last part of \nthe association, represents the minutes; so I know that my \nswimming date is for Wednesday at 12:10. \nThese are the ideas that I use; but again let me stress \nthat what is best for me, is not necessarily best for you. This \nmust be left to your own discretion; which I'm sure you \nwill use, once you understand the basic principles involved. \nYou might be wondering about one little thing at this \npoint, and that is, \"How do I differentiate between say, \n7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.?\" Well, that is a good theoretical \nquestion, but if you stop to think for a moment, you will \nrealize that there can hardly be any conflict, if you use this \nsystem for practical purposes. The appointments that you \nmake for the evening are usually so vastly different than \nthose made for the morning, that they couldn't possibly be- \ncome confused. You will certainly know, for example, \nAppointments and Schedules  197 \nwhether you usually see your dentist in the morning or in \nthe evening. You also would know that your dinner date is \nfor 7:00 p.m. and not 7:00 a.m. And, if you had an appoint- \nment to meet a friend for lunch in front of the Public Li- \nbrary, and got there at 1:00 a.m., you'd be awfully hungry \nby the time you had lunch. \nSo you see, there's really no problem there. Of course, if \nyou had to, you could put a word into your ridiculous asso- \nciation to tell you whether it was a.m. or p.m. You could use \n\"aim\" for a.m. and \"poem\" for p.m., or any other words \nthat use those letters. You might even use white and black; \nget black into your mental picture to stand for p.m., and \nwhite for a.m. But, believe me, all this is hardly necessary; \nIonly mention it to show that you can remember anything \nwith the use of a conscious association. \nNow you can discard your note and memo pads, if you \nUSE the systems explained in this chapter. Remember, \nonly if you use it, will it help you. Here are the bare bones \nof the system:— \nWhen you make an appointment, transpose the day and \nhour (and/or minutes) to peg words. \nAssociate the appointment itself to these peg words. \nWhen you arise on the morning of each day (or, if you \nlike, the evening before) go over all your pegs for that day. \nWhen you come to a peg that has been used in an asso- \nciation, you'll know it—this will remind you of what you \nhave to do at that particular hour. \nAs the day goes on, you might make it a habit to check \nyour peg words for the day, periodically. This is in case one \nappointment has slipped your mind, even though you were \nreminded of it in the morning. \nIn the next chapter, I will show you how to remember \nimportant dates throughout the year, such as, anniversaries, \nbirthdays, etc., but for the time being, you should never \n198 Appointments and Schedules  \nforget any weekly appointments, if you follow these rules. \nThe information you've been taught here can be prac- \nticed, or used as a memory stunt in the following man- \nner:— \nHave a friend call out certain errands for different hours \nof different days of the week. They needn't be called in \norder, since appointments are never made in any particular \norder, anyway. Have him write these down as he calls them \noff to you. After he has called about twenty of them, simply \ngo over your peg words for Monday (toes, tot, tin, tomb, \netc.) and call back all the Monday appointments. Do the \nsame for each day of the entire week. Or, he can give you \nthe time of day, and the day, and you give him the errand, \nand so on. \nThen give your friend a half hour to remember the same \nlist. The odds are he will fail miserably! \nIf Pays to Remember Anniversaries, Birthdays \nand Other Important Dates  \n\"Does your husband forget your anniversaries?\" \n\"Never. I remind him of it in June, and again in January; \nand I always get two presents!\" \nIf a man's memory is so poor that he can be led to believe \nthat he has an anniversary every six months—then he de- \nserves to have to buy two presents. \nSeriously though, the Peg system can be applied to re- \nmembering not only important anniversaries, but also im- \nportant dates in history. It is also helpful for memorizing \naddresses, prices or style numbers. \nAs far as dates are concerned, if you want to remember \npeople's anniversaries or birthdays, just associate the people, \nor substitute words for their names, to the date, in this \nway:— Suppose Mr. Gordon's birthday is April 3rd. If you \nassociate Mr. Gordon, or the word, \"garden\" to \"ram,\" you \nwould remember it. \"Ram\" represents 43, and Mr. Gor- \ndon's birthday falls in the 4th month, on the 3rd day! \nOf course every date will not be able to be transposed \ninto a basic peg word. You can do that only with those that \nfall within the first nine months, and for the first nine days \nof those months. All other dates will be a three digit num- \n199 \n200        Anniversaries, Birthdays and Other Important Dates  \nber, so a different idea must be used. I could tell you to \nmake up a word which would represent the three digit num- \nber, and I will tell you to do that in most cases. But, if done \nall the time, it may confuse you. \nIf the word in your association was \"tighten\" (112), how \nwould you know whether it meant the first month, 12th \nday, or the nth month, 2nd day? You wouldn't, and your \nbirthday card would be a bit late if you sent it on Novem- \nber 2nd to someone whose birthday is January 12th. It \nwould be late, or about two months too early. \nSo, you must have a definite distinction to avoid this. I \nwould suggest that the easiest way to do it is to use one \nword for the three digits, only for the first nine months. \nFor October, November and December, use two words, \nyour peg word to represent the month, and another word to \nrepresent the day. If you feel that you wouldn't know \nwhich word came first, then always use a word that is not \nabasic peg word for your day. That way you'll know that \nthe regular peg always represents the month. \nActually this isn't necessary if you're going to use one \nword to represent the month and day for the first nine \nmonths. If you do, you will know that wherever you have \ntwo words in your association, the one that denotes two \ndigits must represent the month, and the other, the day. \nIf you have two words in your association, both of which \ndenote two digits, then naturally the one over twelve would \nhave to stand for the day. Only in the few cases where the \nday is either the 10th, 11th or 12th in the 10th, 11th or \n12th month will you have to use the ideas suggested in the \nchapter on telephone numbers. You would have to use a \n\"logical illogical\" picture to know which word comes first, \nor, always use the basic peg word for the month, and make \nup a word that fits phonetically, but is not a regular peg \nword, for the day. \nAnniversaries, Birthdays and Other Important Dates  201 \nIf, as in school work, it is necessary for you to remember \nthe year as well as the month and day—simply get a word \nto represent the year into your association. For instance, al- \nthough everybody knows the date of the signing of the \nDeclaration of Independence, I can use that as an example. \nIf you associated the Declaration, or a substitute word, to \n\"car cash,\" you would know that it was signed on July 4th \n(7-4—car) in the year 1776 (76—cash). It is almost never \nnecessary to bother with the first two digits of the year, be- \ncause you would usually know the century in which an \nevent occurred. If not, get a word for those digits into your \npicture, too. \nSchool students usually have to remember only the year \nof an historical event. This is a cinch, because all you need \nin your association, besides the event itself, is one word to \nrepresent the year. Napoleon was crowned emperor in the \nyear 1804. If you made a ridiculous picture of Napoleon \nbeing crowned, and the crown hurting his head, or making \nit sore (04), you would remember it. \nThe Chicago fire was in 1871; just associate fire to \"cot\" \n(71). If you made a ridiculous picture of a giant ocean \nliner sinking because it is made of \"tin,\" you would remem- \nber that the Titanic went down in 1912. \nSometimes it is necessary to remember the year of birth \nand the year of the death of important people. Just as an \nexample, if you made an association of a stevedore dressed \nas a lass, fighting a bear—you would recall that Robert \nLouis Stevenson (stevedore) was born in 1850 (lass) and \ndied in 1894 (bear). \nNow you won't be like the little boy, who when asked \nhow he was doing in school, complained that the teacher \nexpected him to know about things that happened before \nhe was born! \nTalking about school work, in Geography it is often im- \nportant to know the products that a country exports. So, \nwhy not use the Link method to remember them. Also, if \nyou want to remember the general outline of the map of \nany country or state, you can always use the idea that is \nusually used to remember the shape of Italy. \nItaly is shaped like a boot, which makes it easy to recall. \nIf you look at the map outline of any country, with a little \nimagination you can make it look like something that can \nbe pictured. Just associate that to the name of the country, \nand you'll always have a general idea of its shape. \nNow, if you fellows want to be able to throw away those \nlittle black books full of addresses, you can. Just remember \nthe addresses of the young ladies by using associations. The \nsame methods apply to this. Simply transpose all the num- \nbers into sounds, the sounds into words, and associate the \nwords to the person living at that address. If you made a \npicture in your mind of yourself flying a rope, and landing \nit on a carpet (landed rope)—it would help in remember- \ning that Mr. Karpel lives at 5211 (landed) 49th Street \n(rope). \n2O2         Anniversaries, Birthdays and Other Important Dates\nThe same ideas, of course, apply to style numbers and \nprices. If you happen to work in the clothing line, and wish \nto remember the style numbers of, say, dresses—associate \nthe number to an outstanding feature of the dress. If style \n#351 is a dress with a back panel, you might \"see\" that \npanel melting; melt—351. The dress with puffed sleeves \nis style #3140; associate \"mattress\" to the puffed sleeves, \netc. \nThe prices of the dresses can be included in the same \nassociation. I'm giving you only one or two examples for \neach idea, because it is always best for you to use your own \nimagination. It is entirely up to you as to which method \nyou will use for remembering dates and how you will asso- \nciate style numbers and prices, etc. The ideas, however, \ncan be applied in any business. \nPrices can be memorized just as anything else that has \nto do with numbers. Just associate the price to the item. To \navoid confusion, you might decide to always use the basic \npeg words for dollars, and any other word that fits phonet- \nically, for cents. The same methods have to be used here, \nas for telephone numbers and dates. You can use one word \nto represent three or four digits because you'll usually know \nif an item is priced in the hundreds of dollars, or not. \nIf you had associated \"maple\" with book, you'd know \nthat the price of the book is probably $3.95, and not \nAnniversaries, Birthdays and Other Important Dates        203\n204        Anniversaries, Birthdays and Other Important Dates  \n$395.00. On the other hand, if you had associated \"maple\" \nto television set, it would be $395.00, not $3.95, or I would \nbuy a couple of dozen. \nWell, there you are. After this you should never forget \nany dates, prices, style numbers, addresses, and so on. I \nmust repeat that it might seem easier, at first, to write \ndown this type of information, but after awhile you will \nbe able to associate faster than you can write. \nMost important, don't worry about cluttering your mind \nwith all these associations. Again, I want to remind you that \nonce you have memorized the information through associa- \ntions—and you use this particular information; well, you've \netched it into your mind. The associations have served their \npurpose and you can forget about them. \nMemory Demonstrations  \nAfew theatrical agents were gathered together at a carnival, \nto see an act that everyone was raving about. As everybody \nwatched in awed silence, Bosco, the Great, climbed up a ladder \nto a tiny pedestal, four hundred feet in the air. \nOn the pedestal, he took a deep breath, and then started \nto pump his arms to and fro. The drums rolled until they \nreached a noisy crescendo, and at this precise second, Bosco, \nthe Great, actually left the pedestal and flew! \nHis arms pumping madly, he flew around the entire arena, \nup and down, back and forth. \nJust then one of the agents turned to another, and asked, \n\"Is that all he does, bird imitations?\"! \nIsuppose that some of you are wondering why I am teach- \ning, or have taught, all the memory feats in this book. You \nthink that since I am a performer, and my performance \ndoes consist of memory stunts—I am creating competition \nfor myself. Well, perhaps I am, but it doesn't bother me \ntoo much. I know that if any of you do want to perform \nin front of an audience, you will have the ingenuity to \nput together your own stunts and plan your own routine. \nAnd, most important, you will realize that you have to sell \nyourself, not your memory feats. \nMost of the people in show business are aware of the \nfact that it's not what you do that makes you a good enter- \n205 \n206 Memory Demonstrations  \ntainer, but the way that you do it. The specialties that \nperformers do, are simply means to an end. Whether you \ntell jokes, dance, sing, do memory feats, acrobatics or bird \nimitations is unimportant, as long as you entertain your \naudience. \nAlthough my main reason for teaching you the memory \nstunts is that the ideas used in them can be applied for \npractical purposes in many ways—I also feel that the best \nway to learn the systems, is to give you an incentive by \ngiving you something with which to showoff for your friends. \nSo, if you want to use the stunts to entertain at your lodge \nmeeting or church affairs, feel free to do so. However, be \nsure that you know them well enough so that you do credit \nto yourself and my system. \nThere are unscrupulous characters in show business as \nwell as in other fields, who would do anything they feel \nwill further their careers. There is one \"culprit\" who steals \nanew act every year or so. Last year, he did me the \"honor\" \nof stealing my entire act, leaving out only the difficult \ndemonstrations. \nPeople who \"steal\" material are common in show busi- \nness, but to take someone's entire act is almost unheard \nof. However, this fellow did it, but what annoys me, is not \nso much that he is doing my act, but that he does not do \nit well. This is to be expected because if he was a good \nentertainer, he would never have to resort to using an act \nor idea that someone else has already built up. \nNo, I don't mind creating competition for myself by \nexposing these memory feats—as long as the competition \nis good. As a matter of fact, the rest of this chapter consists \nof stunts that I have used, and some that I still use occa- \nsionally. \nOne of the stunts you can use, is remembering objects \nand initials. First have your friends call any object and any \nMemory Demonstrations  207 \ntwo initials. Do this with as many as you feel you can han- \ndle. Then you have the audience call any object and you give \nthem the initials, or vice versa. \nThis stunt is not only impressive, but easy to do. Just \nmake up a word that starts with the first initial and ends \nwith the last, and associate that word to the object called. \nFor example:— If the initials are R. T., and the object \nis \"chandelier,\" you might associate rat to chandelier. The \ninitials B. D. and bottle—associate bed to bottle. The \ninitials P. S. and fan—associate puss to fan, etc. \nHere is another example of how the systems can be \ntwisted and manipulated—you can do the \"missing card\" \nstunt with numbers if you want to. Have someone number \nasheet of paper from 1 to 52, or up to any number you \nlike. Have them call numbers haphazardly and cross out \nthe numbers as they call them. They can stop calling them \nany time they like, and you can tell them which numbers \nare not crossed out! \nDo exactly as you do for the \"missing cards.\" Just \nmutilate the peg words which represent the numbers called. \nThen go over your words mentally from \"tie\" to the peg \nword of the last number listed on the paper. When you \ncome to one that is not mutilated, that is one of the \"miss- \ning\" numbers. \nOne very impressive card demonstration is the \"hidden \ncard\" feat. This is most effective when you are working for \nagroup of at least fifty-two people. (For less people, use \nless cards.) Hand the deck to the audience and let everyone \ntake one card. Now, have each person call the name of his \ncard and also give you a hiding place for it. \nWhat you do, is associate the card word for the card \ncalled to the hiding place. If someone called the Jack of \nSpades hidden in a typewriter, you would perhaps, see \nyourself shoveling typewriters (with a spade}. \n208 Memory Demonstrations  \nAfter all the cards have been \"hidden,\" you can hear the \nname of a card and immediately give the hiding place. Or, \nyou are given the hiding place, and you name the card \nhidden there! \nDo you want to impress your friends with your ability \nto remember numbers? Well, if you've learned another \npeg list up to 16 or 20, as I've taught you, you can do \nthis:— \nHave your challenger number a piece of paper from 1 to \n16 or 20. Then have him call any of these numbers and \nwrite a two digit number alongside. When all the numbers \nhave been called, you can go from one to the end telling \nhim the two digit numbers—or, have him call any two \ndigit number and you tell him what number it is at, or \nvice versa. \nJust use your other list to remember the sequence, and \nuse your basic pegs for the two digit numbers, i.e., #3 is \ncalled, and the two digit number to remember is 34. Well, \nif you're using the alphabet list, you would associate \"sea\" \n(3) to \"mower\" (34). The #14 is called and the number \nto remember is 89—associate \"hen\" (14) to \"fob\" (89). \nIf you feel confident, you can have your friends call an \nobject and a two digit number for each number listed. You \ncan memorize both, by making one ridiculous picture for \nall three. The number called could be #9, the object is a \ntoaster, and the two digit number is 24. Any combination \nof associations is possible here; you could see Nero (24) \npopping out of a toaster, playing on an eye (9) instead of \nafiddle! I have been using the alphabet list idea in these \nexamples. Of course, you could use the other idea wherein \nthe pegs look like the numbers they represent. In that case, \n9would be \"tape measure,\" 3 would be \"clover,\" 14 would \nbe \"farm,\" etc. \nAny one of the systems in this book can be used for a \nMemory Demonstrations  209 \nstunt of some sort, just as the ideas for all the stunts can \nbe used for practical purposes in some way. If you want to \napply substitute words to a stunt, you can memorize names \nand playing cards, names and objects, and so on. You can \nutilize the system for remembering long digit numbers, by \nhaving people call their names and the serial number on a \ndollar bill, or their social security number. Then you should \nbe able to give the number when you hear the name, and \ngive the name if you hear the number. To do this you \nsimply make up a substitute word for the name, if necessary; \nassociate that to the peg word for the first two digits of \nthe number, and make a link to the end of the number. \nAlthough the following is not actually a stunt, the idea \ngrew from the initial and object feat that I mentioned \nearlier. The Morse code is a very difficult thing to remem- \nber because it is almost completely abstract and intangible. \nThe dots and dashes are meaningless and cannot be pic- \ntured. \nIdon't suppose that too many of you will ever find it \nnecessary to have to remember the Morse code. However, \nIdo want you to see that there is no limit to what you \ncan do with conscious associations, and the knowledge that \nanything meaningless is easy to remember if it is made \nmeaningful. Your only limitation is your own imagination. \nSince dots and dashes have no meaning, I decided to give \nthem meaning by making the letter R stand for dot, and \nthe letter T, or D represent the dash. With this in mind, you \ncan make up a word or phrase for each letter, which can \nbe pictured and that will tell you the code signal for that \nletter. Look at this list:— \nA.- rat E . air \nB—...terror F . . — . rear tire \nC_.-.torture G ----- . tighter \nD—..tearer H . . . . rarer rye \n210 Memory Demonstrations  \nI rower \nJ ratted \nK_ trout \nL retire her \nM toad \nN tier \nO touted \nP rotator \nQ__      tethered  R writer \nS roarer \nT toe \nU rarity \nV re-arrest \nW retied \nX turret \nY treated \nZ teeterer  \nAll that remains to be done, is to associate the word to \nthe letter itself, so that one will remind you of the other. \nYou could use the peg words that sound like the letters— \nassociate ape to rat, bean to terror, sea to torture, dean to \ntearer, eel to air, effort to rear tire, and so on to zebra to \nteeterer. \nOr, you could use the adjective idea by associating an \nadjective that begins with the proper letter, to the word— \nawful rat, big terror, crazy torture, dreamy tearer, excellent \nair, flat rear tire, and so on to zigzag teeterer. If you know \nthe position of all the letters, then you could just use \nyour regular peg words, by associating them to the signal \nword. \nThe way you associate them is up to you. The idea is \nthat now the dots and dashes are no longer unintelligible. \nIt shouldn't take you more than half an hour to memorize \nthe Morse code with this system. Of course, this doesn't \nmean that you will be a telegrapher. Speed in sending code \ncomes only with lots of practice and experience, but the \nsystem does make it easier at the beginning, when you have \nto memorize the signals. \nSo, you see how the systems can be twisted and manipu- \nlated to help you with most any memory problem. I've tried \nto teach you many stunts in this chapter and throughout \nthe book, and I'm sure you'll be able to think of many more. \n...And then there was this theatrical agent who was \nMemory Demonstrations  211 \nwatching an act with a friend. The act was on a high wire, \nhundreds of feet above the ground. There was no net to \ncatch him if he fell. \nHe balanced a golf ball on the wire, and balanced a \nchair, upside down, on the golf ball. He then proceeded to \nstand on his head on one of the upturned chair legs. In this \nprecarious position, he began to play a violin with his feet! \nThe theatrical agent turned to his associate, and sneered, \n\"Aah, a Jascha Heifetz he'll never be!\" \nUse the Systems  \nAviolin virtuoso living in\" America truly believed that he could \nplay so well that he could actually charm a savage beast. De- \nspite the warnings and pleas of his friends, he decided he would \ngo to darkest Africa, unarmed, with only his violin. \nHe stood in a clearing in the dense jungle and began to play. \nAn elephant received his scent, and came charging towards him; \nbut, when he came within hearing distance, he sat down to \nlisten to the beautiful music. \nApanther sprang from a tree with fangs bared, but also \nsuccumbed to the music. Soon a lion appeared to join the \nothers. Before long, many wild animals were seated near the \nvirtuoso; he played on, unharmed. \nJust then a leopard leaped from a nearby tree, onto the \nviolinist, and devoured him! As he stood licking his chops, the \nother animals approached, and asked, \"Why did you do that? \nThe man was playing such lovely music!\" \nThe leopard, cupping his ear, said, \"Eh, what did you say?\" \nSo you see, no matter how beautiful music is, unfortunately, \nif you can't hear it, it doesn't mean a thing. Similarly, no \nmatter how useful and helpful the systems in this book \nare, they won't do you a bit of good if you don't use them. \nIdo hope that most of you have given some time and \nthought to them. If you have, you should be pleased with \nthe progress you've made. The flexibility of the systems, I \nbelieve, is their greatest asset. I, personally, have yet to \n212 \nUse the Systems  213 \ncome across anything, pertaining to memory, to which the \nsystems were not applicable. \nTake the time necessary to learn how to make conscious \nassociations and once you've mastered it, it will take care of \nitself. Every once in awhile you may come across some \npiece of information that you want to remember, that is \nmade to order for an association. If you wanted to remem- \nber that a certain item sold for $17.76, you could, of course, \nuse peg words as you've been taught. However, you have \nall heard of the \"Spirit of '76.\" That phrase will create a \npicture for most of us of the famous portrayal of the \n\"Spirit of \"76\"; a man with a drum, a man with a fife, and \nthe third holding our flag. If you were to associate the item \nin question, with this picture, you would recall that $17.76 \nwas the price. \nThe Japanese volcano, Fujiyama, is 12,365 feet high. \nAgain, you could use peg words to remember this, or you \ncould associate Fujiyama to \"calendar.\" The reason for \n\"calendar\" is that the number of feet is the amount of \nmonths in a year (12), and the amount of days in a year \n(365). You would associate calendar either to volcano, or \nasubstitute word for Fujiyama. \nI'm not suggesting that you do this with all numbers; the \nPeg system is the only infallible one. However, looking for \nnumbers that fall into this category, is good for your imag- \nination and observation, and it helps create an interest in \nnumbers. \nIn an early chapter I told you that you could remember \nthe names of the Dionne quintuplets by remembering the \nword \"macey.\" Now you know that in order to remem- \nber the word, you would have to associate the quints to \n\"macey.\" You might \"see\" Macy's Department Store com- \npletely packed with quints, etc. If you want to know the \nnames of the four living quints, drop the odd e, for Emilie, \n214 Use the Systems \nand you'll remember, Marie, Annette, Cecile and Yvonne. \nThis idea would aid you in recalling the names of the \nfive Great Lakes. If you made a picture in your mind of a \nlot of \"homes\" on a great lake, you would always remember \nthat the Lakes are Lake Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie \nand Superior! \nIf you've learned to make up substitute words quickly \nand easily, this will become your greatest move towards a \nbetter memory. Actually, I should say substitute thoughts \nor pictures; you know by now that it is the picture created \nin your mind that's important, not the word itself. \nDid you know that the capital of New Mexico is Santa \nFe? Well, make a picture of Santa. Claus wearing a Mexican \nsombrero, and you'll probably never forget it. If you \"see\" \nyourself throwing little rocks at an ark, you'll have no \ntrouble recalling that Little Rock is the capital city of \nArkansas. Do you know a girl whose name is Helen or \nUse the Systems  215 \nHelena? Picture her climbing a mountain, to help you \nremember that Helena is the capital of Montana. If you \npicture boys eating raw potatoes, you'll remember that \nBoise is the capital of Idaho (Idaho potatoes). Of course, \nyou could picture Ida hoeing boys, and get the same result. \nYou can easily memorize the capitals of all the forty-eight \nstates with this idea. \nYou understand, I'm sure, that it would have been impos- \nsible for me to give direct examples of how my systems are \napplicable to all businesses. Be assured that they are applica- \nble to just about anything where memory is involved. Your \nown particular problem may require a certain twist or change \nof one of the systems, but you would know that better \nthan I. \nNowadays, most of us are diet conscious, and I've \nnoticed people carrying around little calorie counters to \ntell them what not to eat. Well, this is fine, but you could \nuse the Peg system to help you memorize the amount of \ncalories contained in the foods you usually eat. If you \nmade a ridiculous picture between a fried egg and \"disease,\" \nyou'd know that a fried egg contained 100 calories. Did you \nknow that one tablespoon of mayonnaise contained 92 \ncalories? Well, if you associate it to \"bone,\" you won't \nforget it. If you keep gaining weight, and you drink lots \nof bock beer, you ought to associate \"tackle\" to the beer, \nand you'll remember that an 8 ounce glass contains 175 \ncalories. \nIf any of you still feel that it is too much trouble to use \nmy methods, let me repeat that I call this the \"lazy man's\" \nway of remembering. It is the so-called \"natural\" or rote \nmethod of memory that is difficult. Not only is it difficult, \nbut not as efficient, not as retentive, not as rewarding, and \nnot as much fun. Most important, my methods are unlim- \n216 Use the Systems \nited. At the risk of seeming repetitious—\"you are limited \nonly by your own imagination.\" \nIjust used the word \"repetitious,\" which reminded me \nto mention the fact that many students have trouble remem- \nbering that this word is spelled with an e, not an i. If you \nwould print the word on a piece of paper, making that e \nextra large, make it stand out (repEtitious) and look at it \nfor awhile, you won't misspell it again. If you want to \ncatch your friends, ask them to spell the word, \"liquefy.\" I \nthink nine out of ten people will put an i before the f, \ninstead of an e. Print the word like this:—liqu E fy; look \nat it and concentrate on it for a moment, and the chances \nare you'll spell it correctly from here on in. Try this with \nany word that you are not sure of, and you'll certainly \nimprove your spelling. \nMany of the ideas that were taught to you, were taught \nas memory feats. I've done this for a variety of reasons. \nFirst, I believe that it makes it much easier to learn, \nbecause you can actually see your goal. I've seen too many \npeople start to try to learn something, and then give it up \nmidway because they couldn't see the use or benefit of it \nright in front of their eyes. Seeing the goal gives you an \nadded incentive to learn. The fact that you can use the \nfeats to entertain your friends, is an extra added incentive. \nWhen you can do or understand the stunts, you've \ngrasped the idea, and that's all I care about. Once you've \ngot the idea, you will be able to apply it when you need \nit. This is where you must put your imagination to work. \nAny memory problem that may present itself, can be solved \nby using one or more of the methods and systems; whether \nthey were taught to you in the form of a memory demon- \nstration or otherwise. \nMy purpose in writing this book has been to give you the \nbasis and groundwork of a trained memory. The systems \nUse the Systems  217 \nare more far reaching and more applicable than the space \nallowed me could possibly show. I do hope, however, that \nIhave given you an inkling of what can be done with my \nsystems. The rest is up to you!",
